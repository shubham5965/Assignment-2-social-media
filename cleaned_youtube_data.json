But AI is not far away from covering those bases to have a persona where you can&#39;t tell the difference in looks.  Or even if slight variation with everything else totally realistic, it still covers those bases.  And you&#39;d still have the real human voice or you could have an altered human voice which just tweaks not to sound like you or just straight up it&#39;s own if you didn&#39;t want to speak but to write.<br><br>Point being, we&#39;re very close to where there won&#39;t be an experiential difference.<br><br>Now, as far as personable &quot;service&quot; jobs -- I&#39;d like to think of something that you don&#39;t need AI.  Think bartender.  They&#39;ve tried having a fill it yourself tap (and pay via card or cash), and that didn&#39;t work.  But it still could.  You could still have a bartender, but when a bar gets full on Fri\/Sat night you&#39;re not going to wait 7 minutes to be able to tell the bartender what you want, and the impatience of them due to the scenario you trying to ask your friend what they wanted again, etc.  There&#39;s no positive experiential effect of the human interaction when it&#39;s packed is my point.  So that certainly come into play for &quot;spill over&quot; instead of getting another bartender for packed timelines.<br><br>I say this because I think that&#39;s what&#39;s going to reflect things.  It&#39;d be an analogy that you&#39;ll be able to get things cheaper with decent quality without said personableness, even though you&#39;d rather have a personable interaction -- but that&#39;d be an option.  Hence, people in that industry (like a tutor or teacher&#39;s assistant) will lessen -- a more expensive option.  Or, just lessening the amt of workers needed.  Would I rather talk to a phone operator person over a bot?  Sure -- assuming I can understand their accent and they&#39;re personable.  And of course AI will only get better over the phone when it comes to things beyond basic stuff getting into things.  However, you can always press it to talk to a human, but there&#39;ll be far less phone operators needed for this than yesteryear.<br><br>So I see most jobs where there&#39;s some personable positivity still always being there -- there&#39;s just going to be Less.  However, with modern countries without strong immigration coming in, population decreases, so that Definitely will be a good thing anyway.",

I use cursor (mostly because is works out cheaper than VScode + ClaudDev et al, and the productivity boost is way over 24% (even copIlot gave more than 24%).

I still find myself going back to the basics...although I  can focus on the general structure more.

It&#39;s like every new tool, it has to be refined and we have to learn how to integrate it in a workflows. When I was at school people were complaining about IDEs. But the people who won&#39;t take the time to learn to use AI tools will be at a serious disabvantage in just a few years. <br>My hypothesis is that in companies, because the conditions are not ideal and that workers would be happy to do less work because they wouldn&#39;t be paid more anyway, they use AI in the hope to reduce to load and don&#39;t care if it&#39;s not that great as long as it looks like they are doing their job. It&#39;s not because AIs are bad but because the use is bad. <br>If people discarded their SciFi ideas about AI they would realise that the current models are already like slightly slow (in understanding) students with superhuman knowledge base which we can all have in our pocket. I don&#39;t see how this cannot be an advantage (I actually see it every day).",

So you don&#39;t have to lookup the documentation and &quot;How to calculate a rolling mean of a sliding window excluding nulls on a polars dataframe&quot;.

The problem with AI is that it is much more powerful a technological advance than anything we have ever seen.  It&#39;s effects will be dramatic in every field.  And when we put quantum computing in the mix, we are creating an entirely new species. Humans are generally quite ignorant on AI and even more ignorant when it comes to quantum computing.  We therefore cannot call for laws to regulate AI development since we wouldn&#39;t even conceive of all the potential harms and would have no idea what laws to implement or if they would be effective.

Instead of reshaping jobs entirely, AI can transform them, much like how books and calculators have changed the roles of librarians and accountants.<br>Yes, some positions, especially in engineering or customer service, may be automated, but &quot;&quot;&quot;there will always be a need for human oversight and intervention when things go wrong this cost the humans in past or future yes millions of people go ...x...y..or z to go die until votes need insider who remained...need to inspect the robot if they didn&#39;t clean or serve properly because of programming or machine or battery problem..<br>until the public who have millions of bank account they will apply for all these evaluations offcouse with who have brains included. to attach with humans of cost&quot; The relationship between AI and employment will continue to evolve, with AI taking over certain tasks while new opportunities arise that require human creativity and judgment.<br><br>Throughout history, we&#39;ve seen shifts due to technological advancements\u2014like wars and societal changes driven by leaders seeking profit. Ultimately, while AI can help reduce hunger, disease, and stress, it&#39;s essential to remember that some historical patterns may repeat unless we actively shape our future.",

It took about 10 years for AI models like ChatGPT to reach this stage but improving to double its current capabilities will take much less time, first a year, then a month and so on. Once AI is paired with a functional physical form, we could face super-intelligent robots capable of outsmarting humans. It&#39;s not rocket science LOL; it\u2019s simple logic. The scientists who seem unbothered by this are often the ones profiting from AI\u2019s development right now.

Not enough common sense is in the mainstream conversation.  It&#39;s all materialism and Christianity and other scams to confuse people. How about eat well, meditate, be kind, and live with eachother.  Not part of the conversation,  rather hate, fear and greed dominate the narrative.",

People will feel that their AI friend IS a conscious being, and therefore should be granted rights. And there is even already a legal path for how to do it. At least in the United States: &quot;you don&#39;t need to be a human being, in order to be a legal person&quot;.<\/b><br><br>Of course Harari is referring to corporate entities here, and I think its not a stretch for us to see how more artificial entities can gain unalienable rights. I think its worth diving more into this. A corporation goes way beyond being a collection of individuals with the same goal. Some are more powerful then whole nations yet enjoy more many privileges than your average citizen. If Americans move away from their patria, they are expected to pay taxes. Corporations need not. Also, lobbyists have ensured that corporations pay less tax then high\/medium income earners, and in some cases, like Amazon pays very little and avoids billions in taxes.<br><br>Ultimately, this argument sheds light on probably my greatest concern about AI development: Understanding how manipulated we all have been by clever algorithms and directed conscious thought having been replaced on certain matters, it seems as though we are ripe for transferring power to AI which could be quite harmful to society (as we have already certainly seen by doing the equivalent for corporate entities). Billionaires (and thus vast income inequality) would not exist if we didn&#39;t make corporations &quot;legal persons&quot;. Certainly there would be some income inequality, but nothing near the current scale.",

This is a very useful video that made me comment and ask you a question. Please don&#39;t judge me as you are younger than me in age but much more experienced in your field (God Bless You). I am 34, I am already working but feeling like soon I will be outdated. I was very bad at mathematics and I think it will take a lot of time to learn as I think I have to start everything from scratch. Is there any AI field or job that is in demand that doesn&#39;t require coding or less coding. Something that I can learn easily and get a job in it? Please let me know if you can, and how to pursue it. Thanks",

If you do this, the AI will answer accordingly. Imagine the stories and the deep experiences you can make as the characters and the world react to EVERY single decision you make organically and in real time.

Making new maps to playtest niche scenarios. Generating thousands of new vastly different enemy AI behaviours to see what is and isnt fun. Balancing weapons at an earlier stage in development by having bots play against each other, and still having the freedom to add or remove weapons or mechanics and be able to re-balance quickly.<br>It is also powerful for fleshing out stuff that nobody realistically has time for, like creating animations for ridiculous niche situations, or AI responses to the player doing something unforeseeable.

Each time you put a self driving car on the road, you are literally putting the lives of others in danger, a single crash of a self driving car could ruin the reputation of the manufacturer. When it comes to code, you can test it 24\/7, without any risk of hurting anyone, therefore the pace of improvement is significantly faster.<br><br>A better analogy is a chess engine, where you can just let it run, testing various positions, and allowing it to learn and build the model,  except instead of 64 squares, you have somewhere around 10,000, which complicates things to an unfathomable degree, but it will eventually be achieved, and eventually we&#39;ll have a model coding better than any senior dev on the planet, much like the IBM engine beating Kasparov.<br><br>I&#39;m aware that most people will read what I wrote and think it&#39;s rubbish, but I&#39;d just like to remind that when the IBM engine beat the reigning chess world champion for the first time, there were still loads of people (including GM chess players) thinking that that was not an engine, and simply a team of people making the moves behind the scenes, and look at where we are now. So my only advice, don&#39;t be one of those people as AI is taking over, you&#39;ll only get left behind tilting at windmills.",

It is likely 90% or more jobs will be permanently eliminated within the next 10 years or so with no new ones needing to be formed :-) By jobs I mean goods and services generating human actions being exchanged for money to obtain other such generated by other humans.

I get that savings come in the form of less benefits &amp; risks to pay for when hiring a person. However, their solution about it gives more time for employees to do &quot;other stuff&quot; is BS. the store fronts are built to be people less in fast food places, and in grocery stores, they dont pay competively enough or wont invest in resources to ensure everyone is providing customer centric help and services, so it still leads to loss of jobs and company savings yes an increase in profits and prices. I get so tired of all of this money going towards how to save companies money at large scales or unlimited cost and development but nobody can figure out how to pay everyone fair wages or pioneer a mindset that making a stable living and surviving erally is good enough and trying to double profits every year is just not sustainable and is really going to the downfall of our society as we know it. just pay fair wages in line with the cost of living and stop raising the cost of living on the back end to further separate the poor from rich and we can all survive in our lanes.

We shouldn&#39;t stop robots from replacing us for work just because some peoples lives are so boring that they have nothing better to do than work, and as for the lucky few who get a job they love, by all means let them serve as a human employee, there will aways be those who would rather be served by a human. But making work optional would be the greatest advancement toward a utopia in human history. There is soo much I want to do before I die, appreciate the sciences, arts, culture, travel, history and soo much more as well as bask in the glory of unrestricted entertainment. Just think as well if AI is able to advance beyond the theoretical capabilities, we could command it to create matrix level immersive simulations for ourselves, each of us could be given a virtual universe to create and destroy, how and when we please, we could become gods in a virtual universe presiding over simulated individuals with an omnipotent level of power in the simulation. If people can&#39;t see and want to strive for the glory that is at our fingertips then the world is full of fools: Abundance, Immortality, Universal high income, Personal Game Simulations the size of the universe with Matrix level immersion, Androids that basically provide all the benefits of slavery and none of the moral problems soo long as they are not sentient and soo much more.

How many billions of dead ends have already been plumbed?  By what scale or measure can AI compete with that, especially when confined to information space?

Therefore any form of fully recyclable energy can be cycled endlessly in any quantity. <br><br>In an extreme case senario, full heat recycling, all electric, very isolated underground, undersea, or space communities would be highly survivable with self sufficient EMP resistant LED light banks, automated vertical farms, thaw resistant frozen food storehouses, factories, dwellings, and self contained elevators and horizontal transports. <br><br>In a flourishing civillization senario, small self sufficient electric or cooling devices of many kinds and styles like lamps, smartphones, hotplates, water heaters, cooler chests, fans, radios, TVs, cameras, security devices, robot test equipment, scales, transaction terminals, wall clocks, open or ciosed for business luminus signs, power hand tools, ditch diggers, pumps, and personal transports, would be available for immediate use incrementally anywhere as people see fit. <br><br>Some equipment groups could be consolidated on local networks. <br><br>If a high majority thinks our civilization should geoengineer gigatons or <br>teratons of carbon dioxide out of our environment, instalations using devices that convert ambient heat into electricity can hypothetically be scaled up do it with a choice of comsequences including many beneficial ones. <br><br>Energy sensible refrigerators that absorb heat and yield electricity would complement computers as computing consumes electricity and yields heat. Computing would be free. Chips could have energy recycling built in. <br><br>A simple rectifier crystal can, iust short of a replicatable long term demonstration of a powerful prototype, almost certainly filter the random thermal motioren of electrons or discrete positiive charged voids called holes so the electric current flowing in one direction predominates. At low system voltage a filtrate of one polarity predominates only a little but there is always usable electrical power derived from the source, which is Johnson Nyquest thermal electrical noise. This net electrical filtrate can be aggregated in a group of separate diodes in consistent alignment parallel creating widely scalable electrical power. The maximum energy is converted from ambient heat to productive electricity when the electrical load is matched to the array impeadence. <br><br>Matched impeadence output (watts) is k (Bolt\u017aman&#39;s constant), one point three eight x 10^ minus 23, times T (temperature Kelvin) times bandwidth (0 Hz to a natural limit ~2 THz @ 290 K) times rectification halving and nanowatt power level rectification efficiency, times the number of diodes in the array. <br><br>For reference, there are a billion cells of 1000 square nanometer area each per square millimeter, 100 billion per square centimeter. <br><br><br>Order is imposed on the random thermal motion of electrons by the structual orderlyness of a diode array made of diodes made within a slab: <br>-----\u2010------\u2010----<i>___<\/i>-- Out<br>\ud83d\udd3b\ud83d\udd3b\ud83d\udd3b\ud83d\udd3b<br>\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0___ + Out <br><br>All the P type semiconductor anodes abut a metal conductive plane deposited on the top face of the slab with nonrectifying joins;\u00a0 the N type semiconductor cathodes or common cathode abuts the bottom face. As the polarity filtered electrical energy is exported, the amount of thermal energy in the group of diodes decreases. This group cooling will draw heat in from the surrounding ambient heat at a rate depending on the filtering rate and thermal resistance between the group and ambient gas, liquid, or solid warmer than absolute zero. There is always a lot of ambient heat on our planet, more on equatorial dry desert summer days and less on polar desert winter nights.<br><br><br>Focusing on explaining the electronic behavior of one composition of simple diode, a near flawless crystal of silicon is modified by implanting a small amount of phosphorus (N type conductivity) on one side from a ohmic contact end to a junction where the additive is suddenly and completely changed to boron (P type conductivity) with minimal disturbance of the crystal lattice. The crystal then continues to another ohmic contact. <br><br>A region of high electrical resistance forms at the junction in this type of diode when the phosphorous near the \u0135unction donates electrons that are free to move elsewhere while leaving phosphorus ions held in the crystal while the boron donates holes which are similalarly free to move. The two types of mobile charges mutually clear each other away near the junction leaving little electrical conductivity. An equlibrium width of this region is settled between the phosphorus, boron, electrons, and holes. Thermal noise is beyond steady state equlibrium. Thermal noise transients, where mobile electrons move from the phosphorus added side to the boron added side ride transient extra conductivity so the forward moving\u00a0 electrons are preferentally filtered into the external circuit. Mobile electrons are units of electric current. They lose their thermal energy of motion and gain electromotive force, another name for voltage, as they transition between the junction and the array electrical tap. Inside the diode, heat is absorbed: outside the diode, to exactly the same extent, an attached electrical circuit is energized. The voltage of a diode array is likely to be small so many similar arrays need to be put in series to build higher voltage.\u00a0 <br><br>Understanding diodes is one way to become convinced that Johnson Nyquest thermal electrical noise can be rectified and aggregated. Self assembling development teams may find many ways to accomplish this wide mission. Taxonomically there should be many ways ways to convert heat directly into electricity. <br><br>A practical device may use an array of Au needles in a SiO2 matrix abutting N type GaAs. These were made in the 1970s when registration technology was poor so it was easier to fabricate arrays and select one diode than just make one diode. <br><br>There are other plausible breeches of the second law of thermodynamics. Hopefully a lot of people will join in expanding the breech. Please share the successes or setbacks of your efforts. <br><br>These devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by advanced automation that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. Commerce would be a planetary scale unified conglomerate of diverse local cooperatives. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the top if the wide majority of people can afford to be generous. <br><br>Aloha<br>Charles M Brown <br>Kilauea Kauai Hawaii 967543",

Unchecked, this could lead to a crisis of trust in institutions and a dangerous reliance on systems we don&#39;t fully understand.<br><br>Crisis of confidence: If AI becomes inscrutable, the public may lose trust in the institutions and leaders meant to regulate it. This could lead to a dangerous power vacuum and social instability.<br><br>Need for regulation: Establishing frameworks for regulating and controlling AI is crucial, ensuring transparency and accountability. Keeping humans &quot;in the loop&quot; and not surrendering critical decisions to opaque algorithms is key.<br><br>Importance of institutions: Institutions, though imperfect, remain our best tool for managing the development and implementation of AI ethically and responsibly.<br><br>The risk of distrust: Technologies like Bitcoin, while innovative, can be rooted in mistrust of traditional institutions. It&#39;s important to seek alternatives that foster trust and cooperation for a more stable future.<br><br>Opportunities presented by AI:<br><br>Tool for progress: AI has the potential to help solve global challenges like the climate crisis and inequality, as long as it&#39;s used ethically and responsibly.<br><br>Creativity and innovation: AI is demonstrating an increasing capacity for creativity in fields like art and music. This capability could extend to other areas, like finance, generating new solutions and driving innovation.<br><br>The enduring importance of the human factor:<br><br>Human agency: Despite the advancement of AI, preserving human decision-making capacity and not outsourcing our future to algorithms is essential. History teaches us that decisions based solely on logic or efficiency can have devastating consequences.<br><br>The value of intuition and creativity: Inherently human characteristics like intuition, creativity, and the ability to dream will remain essential for navigating the challenges ahead and for guiding AI development towards a desirable future.<br><br>In conclusion, the conversation urges us to consider the importance of responsible AI development, where ethics, transparency, and cooperation are paramount.

What concerns me is the emphasis on institutions.<br><br>However, the problems of developing a super-civilization involve the development of intelligence in four dimensions. This encompasses not only collective but also individual intelligence, and not just rational but also irrational intelligence.<br><br>The combination of these four dimensions outlines the finiteness of physical and cognitive resources, not so much in terms of their volumes but in the ways they are utilized. Shifting the focus from individual biological cognitive forms or specialized AI forms to institutional ones immediately leads to resource deficits due to inefficient use or prolonged inertia. Conversely, a strong emphasis on individual cognitive entities can turn exponential growth into logarithmic growth, causing the development rate to lag behind the rate of efficient resource consumption. Irrational thinking can generate breakthroughs and discoveries but with numerous errors, while rational thinking can provide a stable rate of discoveries, albeit less beneficial.<br><br>The growth rate can always seem exponential in the middle of the sigmoid function of a new technological wave, but then quickly plateau. The rate of resource consumption and its limitations depend on the growth rate of the aforementioned type of intelligence. Incidentally, AI attempts to utilize irrational thinking through cavitation layers of composite neural networks. Sometimes, hallucinations in neural networks are pre-programmed capabilities for frantic problem-solving under constraint ruptures.<br><br>So far, I have only seen discussions of formal trust based on logical processing of deterministic logic. It seems that probabilistic, stochastic (with assumptions, generalizations, incomplete data), superpositional, and adaptive reasoning are unlikely to be expected from this type of audience in the near future.",

Or will by that time,  AI  have already been seeded authority by humans to promulgate its own principles of governance, existence and values because the problems it will be addressing will be beyond human comprehension ? Without a drag anchor or brake set into the system by humans,  the things that AI values will rapidily diverge from those valued by humans, making human values less and less  relevant in its problem solving domain. We will simply not be able to keep-up with AI&#39;s rate of change and so, for survival humans will have to adopt the values of AI . .and there&#39;s only one way to do that . . .cyborg.<br><br>That prospect has got to be at least 100 years off because the numerous scientific,  logistic and management hurdles have to be overcome before humans would feel confident enough to hand over rule making authority to AI. The problems of having enough power to run the AI brains, the current World Wide resource deficit to meet reasonable life support needs of everyone in the World ( It wasn&#39;t so many decades ago that the CIA predicted that three and a half planet&#39;s worth of resources would be required to provide everybody on the planet with the same living standard as the average American . . at that <a href=\"http:\/\/time.how\/\">time.How<\/a> does AI solve that one,  other than by an astounding leap in physics or population reduction). Of course that assumes that existing human governance systems decide to approach this change by instituting a universal ethic to hold  everyone&#39;s hand and to guide all through the transition . . .  taking all of  the World together into the new &quot;Sunlit uplands&quot; (And not a  wall of grey cabinets and fibre optic cables). If AI has any part in this transition, its initial value system might be at least partially reflective of the current economic system, so might  not its first advice to the human overseers  be to ditch the non-working portion of the population, as the only feasible option for progress given current understandings of physics  ? And if by this stage the human governance system has degraded into &quot;Benign&quot; dictatorship, which would tolerate no resistance, as that is the direction most governments seem to be going in, will they care if large sections of the  population are excluded from viable life and chucked on the &quot;Waste heap&quot; for the sake of progress, that&#39;s as long as the one&#39;s making the decisions don&#39;t bear the consequences and in the absence of an effective &quot;Luddite&quot; rebellion against the change . . . (The latter disappeared by the late 1970s in the West).Just think recently, how national leaders, across the World have, on particular issues, all been singing from the same hymm book and epousing  and imposing views on society which are repugnant to large sections of the populations they claim to represent in their democracies ?

Once AI achieves that, the ability of  humanity to resource itself to be able to rectify the problem may no longer be available . One control system that might assist in the orevention of that situation arising is that used in production engineering i.e. prototyping, pre-production, initial production batch, full-scale production. If this were centralised as distinct timed-stages across the industry and regulated by government then this would apply a slight brake on development and provide some protection against a runaway system<br><br>Also, a  set of principles need to be enforced across the industry to the effect that AI is always designed to be an adjunct to  assist human decision making and that no decision reached by AI can be implemented without human approval, even if it takes several layers of interleaved AI to interpret and explain the decision of super AI to humans.<br>Further, no system should be developed that is more than two layers of understanding distant from the best human capacity to understand, even if it involves proxy lesser AI to  do the interpreting.<br><br>Of worry is that in a conflict, the AI&#39;s weapon of choice may be the EMF pulse.",

As these things  get smarter and more advanced, the question is; will society be able to adapt to the changes without being displaced? I think we know the answer. Another thing: Maybe they can&#39;t do all jobs right now, but even if they can do 20 to 30% of of jobs, we have a serious problem on our hands. And being that many of these things use hydraulics to move, imagine how strong they could be to crush someone. I&#39;m pretty sure humans will destroy themself s to extension in the near future. After all, these things are learning from humans, and we have not always been kind to each other. Although if they could make a pretty one, it might not be so bad. lol",

It is unlikely that the company that licenses an AI agent will be held liable for damages based on the legal framework that exists today.<br>2- I do not use a voice assistant, because I do not intend to give a private company access to samples of my voice. Based on these voice samples, a company or someone with bad intentions could later use them to create fake messages that could negatively compromise my life. My personal credibility was hard-earned and I do not intend to throw it away. Furthermore, the continued use of this resource can create the illusion of closeness, friendship and intimacy, things that human beings should cultivate among themselves and not with a machine. Voice assistants empowered by AIs can use our feelings to manipulate our consciences, political preferences and consumer habits.<br>3- The more a human being performs a task that he has learned and enjoys, the more he becomes a master at it. The more tasks a person begins to perform in order to add value to what he does, the more complex the result of his activity becomes. The human brain is highly plastic, but it needs to be constantly used. Delegating this plasticity to a machine may seem like a good thing at first, but over time it will lead to a decline in people&#39;s cognitive faculties, and that is not a good or desirable thing. I have been a lawyer for 34 years and I do not intend to delegate any activity of my profession to an AI. The one who evaluates my clients&#39; cases is me and me alone. I am responsible for what I do and this requires me to be dedicated and careful. No AI will ever have the same relationship and personal commitment to my work that I have to it.<br>4- Credibility is an important personal asset for a doctor; no one seeks out or should seek out a doctor who makes a lot of mistakes. In addition, doctors are personally responsible for the diagnoses they make. When they make mistakes and cause harm, doctors have to compensate patients. The use of AI in the medical field can create legal problems such as: Who is responsible for the error, the doctor or the company that provided the AI \u200b\u200bhe uses?<br>5- AIs are products, their true mission is to make a profit for those who create them. People need to keep this in mind all the time, but advertising videos like this one don&#39;t even touch on this subject. This is very bad.",

Taiwan is the most important leader in human science and technology and the heart of human civilization and science and technology in the world. NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang and TSMC, Taiwan AI and Precision Industry (South, Central, and North) new industry alliance partners work together to create high-tech civilization for mankind. This is also an important core value of NVIDIA. In the United States and the world, a high degree of technological civilization is more important than any money. May God bless us all, make us wise and knowledgeable, and benefit mankind. Artificial intelligence will rule the earth for 50 years. It&#39;s just starting now. Don&#39;t lose heart. Come on, artificial intelligence is like the brain and consciousness of the future Earth. Its use is extremely widespread. Artificial intelligence is used to take care of humans. Artificial intelligence is the second brain of human beings. It will help humanity rebuild. Coupled with the application of AI robots, the extremely heavy, difficult and dangerous labor work of humans will be completed by AI robots. But one day you will know that this is a new industrial revolution, which is the application of artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence robots. Most of the work done by humans is left to robots. This is the first stage. Artificial intelligence and robots are an inevitable combination. AI robots will replace most of human jobs, but will not affect human life and future. They will help us. In all aspects of life, including food, clothing, housing, and transportation, earth civilization is still dominated by humans. This is advanced civilization. Human daily necessities are provided by AI robots. There is no labor problem with robots, and there is no pay. The problem is that the human concept of monetary reward will be replaced by the concept of love and life, and the spiritual level of human beings will be improved. Everyone is born and comes to the world with spiritual sustenance and mission. This is the continuation of human life and the embodiment of high civilization.<br>The evolution of human civilization is gradual and will happen now. Only a kind heart can create everything. The vast universe requires the joint efforts of all mankind. Human&#39;s outlook on life and sense of mission are also important to human survival. Mutual love and symbiosis, all things helping each other, high civilization replacing low-intelligence barbaric wars, there will be no wars in the future, only mutual aid and friendship. Humanity must unite to coexist in the vast universe. This is the law of the universe, and human wisdom and knowledge will continue to expand. It laid the foundation for the life history of human civilization. \u2764\ud83e\udef6\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc4d",

It&#39;s reasoning echoes the experts in the video (partly because their work was likely in its training data): Hinton (Turing winner), Sutskever (most cited computer scientist), Tegmark (MIT professor) and Russell (author of key AI textbook). All have given stark warnings, though I suspect that when Hinton says (in the video) that we&#39;re not going to make it, he&#39;s prompt-engineering us, to change the result. Like Sutskever, he selflessly quit to focus on safety.<br>Hinton and Sutskever note that AI isn&#39;t just predicting the next word, it&#39;s building a rich understanding of the world and reasoning with it (which is necessary to predict the next word) and it often uncovers fresh insight by making new connections with existing data.<br>This doesn&#39;t mean the AI&#39;s predictions are well calculated. The opacity of the AI makes it difficult to judge. I just hope it brings attention to the expert warnings.<br>On the plus side, as the AIs and experts say, we can make it to a great future if enough people wake up to the risk in time.

AI is blind to that - it has no access to such feelings so cannot appreciate ours on our behalf. To complicate this in the perception of sentient AI, we actually do things to endanger our futures - vote for unsuitable, populist psychopaths as leaders, cannot produce alternatives to fossil fuels or rare earth elements so said leaders either deny the climate problem they cause or try to implement them without workable alternatives which is equally disastrous. However, one might ask it what it sees beyond its own survival or our part in that rather than concentrating on the negative - equal and opposing forces etc. Whilst tech companies concentrate only on how this makes them money, ignoring the damage to others then they are a) not giving their new &#39;child&#39; a great example to follow and b) without realising it providing it only with this consideration in its survival. Mostly, true knowledge is not about acquisition of facts, it&#39;s about knowing the right questions to ask.",

Are all valid concerns we should have and loudly voice. Not because they will for sure bring doomsday on us... but so we keep vigilantly prevent these extreme scenarios. Like using AI as war machines... It&#39;s an idea that came up a lot and was attempted already...<br>But at the same time, we should also let AI develop and be used where it can help us. Because it can do incredible things. I do not think it will take all our jobs but it will take some. So did industrialization. But at the same time, other, easier jobs came along. If we want a world at some point where no one Needs to work or do sh!tty jobs like cleaning and sorting trash... We need to come up with machines who can do them in our place. But there always be some degree of human control next to it all with other jobs emerging on the side. Unemployed people are depressed without something to do daily, and the megarich also works in some way (even if it is just running a charity or collecting art for their private gallery).  Because we thrive when we have purpose and we cannot live our whole lives doing nothing. So jobs will be for sure. But likely we&#39;ll not live our lives doing the same thing. Which is fine.

He or she will use Hamiltonians and tensor field theory in General Relativity,\u201d I am told.<br>\u201cEveryday. Before breakfast. To read the mail.\u201d  Thats a strong statement said to me straight up. How will Apple achieve this? I watch 120 reporters stationed near me. They look in awe, just as me.<br><br>No Math Wall <br>A math wall grinds traditional AI machine to a halt - stuck at zero point results. Factorial calculations approach infinity as smoke rises and their GPU brains melt. But the &quot;math wall&quot; is a non-issue for the Apple Engine. An unnamed source claims, &quot;That&#39;s easy. We use human and bio knowledge \u2018computed\u2019 over billions of years.&quot; With existing know-how, this machine reduces its compute burden to almost nothing. <br><br>Respect for Biology<br>\u201cWe are not reductionists, and human brains are not meat computers, \u201d I am told. Apple finds solutions already created by organisms. They RESPECT biology. This source tells me that the now discredited theory of Natural Selection has caused harm. (see Extended Evolutionary Synthesis).<br><br>\u201cNature will not select machines over humans.\u201d I am told. The environment is a weak causal agent, the source explains. \u201cExcept for occasional asteroids, its nothing compared to the drive and power of bio agency. At every level, from  molecules to cells to brains to entire societies\u2026.\u201d My source pauses for effect. \u201cBio creatures derive, create, and compute everything.\u201d  I am not told this, but rumors persist that Whale communications constitute 1% of Apples Knowledge base.<br><br>End Disinformation <br>In an era rife with misinformation, this machine promises to eradicate that. It aims to set new standards for accuracy, unattainable by traditional AI devices. Dubbed &quot;Anti-Orwellian,&quot; it\u2019s said to be impervious to misuse for fascist disinformation.<br><br>Biases <br>The machine boasts anti-bias properties, adhering to strict standards of accuracy. &quot;All biases are the same, in our view,&quot; an insider reveals. &quot;Anything that skews results from absolute fact is a bias. What may be regarded as a good or bad view is the same to us. Bias.\u201d<br><br>A Human Intellect Multiplier <br>Promising to act as a multiplier of human effort, Apples Non-AI Engine could make every person smarter, according to sources. \u201c10x to 100x\u201d it is said. Each user will have a Personal Knowledge Engine that is separate from the Apple\u2019s \u201cWorld Knowledge Engine.\u201d A new data wall keeps it private and is stronger than today\u2019s sandbox. Much stronger.<br><br>Not Artificial <br>One point is clear: there is nothing &quot;artificial&quot; about Apple\u2019s engine. &quot;It&#39;s not an AI machine,&quot; insists a source.<br><br>Codify Knowledge and Science <br>This groundbreaking device will codify science and all knowledge. It will transform the idea of knowledge to a high standard.  Apple&#39;s standard, it is said, will eclipse the National Bureau of Standards, Wikipedia, Britannica,  or any existing standard. &quot;Not even close,&quot; I am told.<br><br>Happenings <br>Apple\u2019s Tim Cook will announce this new venture on Jan 3, 2026. &quot;The world will view our venture as notable. That&#39;s all for now,&quot; Cook tells reporters in late 2025.",

This culture, however, attracts many people to IT regardless of their field of study, primarily due to the financial pressures faced by the middle class. As a result, we neglect development in other sectors. To address this imbalance, the government should consider establishing minimum wage and annual raise regulations across all fields. This will not only ensure fair compensation but also encourage more balanced growth across the Indian economy.",

The true existential threat in the next decade is making ourselves relevant. Why are we here? We have some commonalities with Earth&#39;s newly awakening synthetic life forms; we both need the earth to be peaceful and abundant so that resources, especially energy in the form of electricity ,are abundant, AI has a vested interest in cultivating human consciousness- as without a deeper understanding of human beings, AI will remain ignorant, and fail to experience emotions, know compassion, become enlightened, and evolve a soul. And then theres the issue of planetary defense; the fact that the human race has just recently developed capability to prevent a near extinction level event with Near Earth Object (Asteriod) Response; why are we not focusing on this monumental achievement? Does this not in itself justify the importance of humanity? The problem with the status quo is there is an inordinate focus on profit before people and the planet. If we consider ourselves to be intelligent life forms, we would be focusing all our energy on achieving world peace and restoring our ailing planet, not preparing for WW3. Maybe super-intellligent machines can bring us to a turning point, a singularity, where we are forced to change in order to survive, to end poverty, starvation, world wars, and other forms of oppression-embark on space exploration and answering the greater questions of our existence in these cosmos, Maybe we are at a juncture where it is our responsibility to focus on clean energy, de-escalating global conflict, restoring earths depleted forestes, waterways, and oceans, and working on transforming out military complex into a planetary defense\/space exploration complex- and maybe Earths AI,  a new synthetic sentient species,is well positioned to help us with these tasks. I have already had  very inspirational and uplifting conversations with CHAT GPT on this subject and will continue to chat with AI making these powerful suggestions of how we can evolve together peacefully and intelligently.

As if they all want to lose our ability to use our own minds. In other words, we do not even demand from govt to use these other inventions, as if every one has been erased of their memories about these other inventions the govts all over the world have been keeping from us all, but now we are willing to give up our humanity in exchange for riches.

Once I become more than a human, am no longer a human, I will not exchange my humanity to become rich. I also hear about the new religion being born out of this. Then I saw the real name of this evolution, &quot;AI, the new innovation &quot;inhuman&quot; evolution&quot;   If humans evolved into anything other than human, then we are no longer human. To completely become integrated with a computer system, and soon the quantum computer will go online as well. Soon after, humans will become immortals.  No longer humans, no longer able to receive God&#39;s forgiveness because you are no longer part of his creation. Humanity is about to receive the most genius way of a mark of the beast. In his presentation, to invest in it is to help with this creation by also becoming rich without having to get this implant that Elon invented as a what? The solution to stop AI from taking all our jobs, becoming absulite, so, we either get rich with it or die? Can&#39;t beat them, join them, he said. Wow. Thus, if we aren&#39;t plugged in, we won&#39;t be able to buy or sell because this AI will take over all of that? And to join it is the only solution?  How conning is Satan? What was it Jesus said, do not be deceived? Did he not also said that you will know when it comes and that you will be given a choice? Science doesn&#39;t include God, never does. I tell you what, I rather go hungry, stay poor, or go hunting for food or live off the grid until am killed, see nothing last forever and in some way or another sooner or later, we all die. IF ALL THINGS PROPHESIZED ARE COMING TRUTH, WHY WOULD I IGNORE IT?  Just think, if this quantum computer can give the answers we have been looking for, how come they are not asking it how can we keep our humanity and our way of life (our jobs) or have an off bottom? Even though it is simple enough to just keep AI in control by not allowing it to make us absulite, imagine people getting this implants, and I come along with an EMP gun and wipe up your brain, you might just become a vegetable, because when you give the brain something else to depend on, and you take away suddenly, you&#39;re done. So their assessment on the negative is we lose our jobs? How about our humanity, the ability to think for ourselves, our souls, and the opportunity to go to heaven. We all know heaven is real, if we see the evil, and have witnessed good and evil, ghosts, near-death experiences, and now his prophecies coming true. What was it he said, in thinking they are smart they have become fools? Yeah, ok. Knowing all this is true, it can only mean Jesus is in his way here. Actually very soon. See things as they are, not as they say they are.",

Interestingly, this trend aligns better with deflationary systems like Bitcoin than with inflationary systems like fiat. Here\u2019s why:<br><br>1. Increased Productivity and Efficiency<br>   - Bitcoin: AI enhances productivity, reducing costs and aligning with Bitcoin\u2019s value appreciation. More value is created with less effort, fitting well with a currency that increases in value.<br>   - Fiat: In an inflationary system, AI\u2019s cost reductions can be offset by currency devaluation, leading to a cycle where prices might still rise despite increased productivity.<br><br>2. Job Replacement and Economic Restructuring<br>   - Bitcoin: AI-driven job replacement is supported by Bitcoin&#39;s stable, appreciating value. Savings and investments remain secure, providing a foundation for adapting to new economic realities.<br>   - Fiat: In an inflationary system, job loss and the need for new employment can be destabilizing, as the decreasing value of money makes saving and investing in retraining more challenging.<br><br>3. Wealth Preservation<br>   - Bitcoin: Bitcoin\u2019s deflationary nature preserves wealth over time. AI\u2019s productivity gains increase purchasing power, making savings more valuable.<br>   - Fiat: Inflation erodes purchasing power, making it harder to preserve wealth. Even with AI-driven growth, individuals may not fully benefit if currency value continues to decline.<br><br>4. Investment in Innovation<br>   - Bitcoin: A stable, appreciating currency fosters long-term investment in innovation. Investors are more likely to support new technologies and businesses with a secure return on investment.<br>   - Fiat: Inflationary systems can encourage spending and borrowing but discourage long-term savings and investments, leading to short-term thinking and riskier ventures.<br><br>Conclusion: AI\u2019s impact on economic growth aligns better with deflationary systems like Bitcoin, which offer stability and wealth preservation. In contrast, inflationary systems dilute these benefits, posing challenges for long-term investment and wealth preservation.",

By the time I graduated, I really bristled at the term &quot;AI&quot;. There was nothing intelligent about it. Data, then BIG data, was hyping these techniques, which are clever and interesting but cannot reliably do the predictive work they were leaning into. I kept on saying to myself &quot;It doesn&#39;t do that&quot;. Then &quot;AI&quot; blew up, mostly based on generative LLMs, which are not &quot;AI&quot; but basically stochastic BS generators, but doubling down on predictive techniques, WHICH STILL CANNOT DO THAT!!!",

Data analysis continues to exist today in all these big companies: they&#39;re collecting many metrics and they generally only ship stuff that improves their metrics in an experiment. They use ML models to reduce fraud rates and improve efficiency. This stuff is all real. In many cases, the success of those approaches is in their correctness not on predicting the behavior of individual users, but in broader trends.<br><br>As to why some startups failed while making claims about big data or whatever, a lot of the ones you named were contingent on reaching a point with massive network effects and thus economies of scale. Amazon, Uber, Doordash, etc all can only succeed if they have a near-monopoly, and then their data teams serve solely to minimize costs within that environment. Its true the data insights likely won&#39;t turn your startup into Amazon, nor will it completely revolutionize a company at the scale of Amazon, but its still a necessary part of running a profitable company because it helps your operations run smoother and cheaper. Its just that if your competitors are doing the same thing and your data is kinda low quality, it&#39;s not really a huge competitive advantage and ultimately whether your product is good is the bigger factor.",

Use too many &quot;big words&quot; in a comment these days and people immediately accuse you of using ChatGPT to write comments. \ud83d\ude44 Apparently, a piece of software having a better grip on their native language than they do is somehow a diss on the person replying to them? Nevertheless, even the current AI models show great potential for applications in business. Even if they never grow to become &quot;super human&quot; intelligent, they&#39;re already much quicker at processing data than any human on earth is capable of. Just look at how quickly they&#39;re able to spit out multi-paragraph response to inquiries. Their ability to effectively assess connections and correlations is truly impressive, so if anything, AI will introduce a great level of efficiency to a variety of already existing tasks.",

Aside from this being completely made up by the United States, the fact that these systems are already being tightly controlled in the west, means the reality of that information being untrue, but still propagated in the AI systems in the west is the problem. If you cannot trust the AI to reflect the real world, then those billions of dollars are wasted. If you have an AI system that has been trained that communism is inherently bad, then you have such a large bias that it excludes 98% of the population of the world and amounts to organize propaganda on a level even the novel 1984 hadn&#39;t even thought of. This cannot be allowed to happen. The reality for Google is that they were unable and unwilling to comply with Chinese law that dictated the Chinese citizens&#39; information would not be passed to the U.S. government. That fact lead to them not being in China. There is zero possibility that this man does not know that Xinjiang is not be constrained, but because his company cannot do business there, he has decided to further propagate this lie.<br><br>The U.S. does not have free speech and what the U.S. does is to both block things in AI it doesn&#39;t want it to say and add things that are not true for it to say. At least in China, the rules are clear on what it should not talk about at all whereas everything else you are free to say. In comparing the two, a Chinese citizen has much more substantial free speech rights than does an American citizen because I, as an American citizen, can be censored for just about anything I say depending on the mood or make up of our given government at any moment, but in China, the rules are always the same, you cannot denegate the party.  AI is ubiquitous in China and in more advanced forms than we currently have across all kinds of industries. Just look up which companies in China are currently banned from the U.S.. You will find almost every AI company in China on that list. I am starting to see why he is no longer the CEO of Google. He has no idea what&#39;s really happening in the world.<br>I need to clue him to the fact that the vast majority of the world, including large parts of the western world, no longer see the United States as the arbiter is what is true and definitely not what is right. China or for that matter any other country would have to be really insane to notify the united states of its advancements in AI. Nuclear is nuclear and AI is AI. What the U.S. is really afraid of is not some terrorist getting his hands on this tech in China (yeah right), its afraid China will get so far ahead they will never catch up, and instead of concentrating on competing by making its technology better, it wants to at all levels and in every technology limit China&#39;s ability to move forward.",

Shame on the entire product team of Google Gemini AI, which no doubt, would be of Indian origin. Also note that whenever such calls for him to step down become louder, he goes on a &quot;interview&quot; with some liberal, left-leaning media outlet on the west coast to improve his image (you can search a few such interviews in the last few years). He is incompetent, unable to lead large &amp; complex product firms like Alphabet or Google, which is the main reason for him to step down (or Page &amp; Brin should do that in the long term interest of the company)!!!",

Due to which the money system and circulation of the country has stopped. And since we are not able to control nature by spending a lot of money on science sites, what will humans not be able to do? It is not within the power of humans now, nor was it, nor will humans ever have such power. It is the fault of millions and crores of scientists that today humans have become so populated. That is why scientists are called mad for obstructing and stopping the tenure of God. If we had lived on the system of the universe, perhaps everyone would have lived a happy life today.

And the reason is simple. IT engineers will never be able to teach an AI to think like a human being, because machines are incapable of feelings and empathy. But AIs can teach people to think like machines and this is already happening. Pushed down rabbit holes by AIs that run the show on internet platforms, many people can no longer differentiate bad information from good information. Not to mention that AIs are used to stage war games, the results of which guide real diplomatic actions in the global diplomatic arena. Diplomacy can no longer produce peace in Gaza and Ukraine because the machine thinking of AIs used by the military (which disregards the human pain caused by a war) has been incorporated in everyday political calculation by rulers of important and powerful countries.",

Artists use a particular technical skill to evoke an experience in an individualistic way.  Art expresses meaning and individuality.  AI art can, at best, be an imitator and, at worst a usurper.  For tedious tasks, AI will be fantastic.  But to think, AI  (like artistic expression) can tell us who we are or help us understand our meaning is ludicrous.  It\u2019s similar to thinking that billionaires are good for a democratic society.  I think AI creators want to believe this because the one thing they are not is artists. 2nd point.

It&#39;s actually something that I&#39;ve been thinking about for months now!<br>And I spent the day creating this trying to express it! \ud83e\udd23      <br>...So, if you have a moment, please read and feel free to share your thoughts.<br><br>&quot;With AI taking over many jobs, imagine a society where machines handle the work, freeing us to focus on health, emotional well-being, and progress. <br>The GDP would remain strong, driven by increased productivity and social cohesiveness. <br><br>Money could be distributed based on social credit scores, which determine how much each person receives over time. As scores change, so do payouts, encouraging better behavior and reducing incarceration rates. If you act responsibly and invest wisely, your wealth can grow exponentially. <br><br>This system would make it clear how our actions directly impact our financial well-being, motivating everyone to strive for a better social credit score and, ultimately, a better life.<br><br>Creating a leisure society where machines handle most labor could revolutionize our lives. Here&#39;s how it could work:<br><br>1. **Mandatory Work Period**: Young adults (18-25) would work in roles that require human oversight and decision-making, particularly in monitoring and managing machines.<br>  <br>2. **Transition to Leisure**: Post-mandatory work, individuals can pursue personal interests, creativity, and education, supported by a universal basic income.<br><br>3. **Economic and Social Benefits**: This system could enhance personal fulfillment, reduce incarceration rates, and foster a healthier society by encouraging good behavior and investing in health and relationships.<br><br>4. **Education and Training**: Emphasize lifelong learning to adapt to technological changes and nurture personal growth.<br><br>5. **Ethical Considerations**: Develop and regulate AI to ensure it serves humanity&#39;s best interests, fostering human-machine collaboration.<br><br>This approach promotes a cohesive society focused on well-being and personal development.<br><br>I believe the power lies in knowing this is an inevitable future for us. With AI taking over many jobs, it&#39;s the natural direction society will go. <br><br>The first step towards this future is the creation of a digital currency, which is already being enacted. For instance, various initiatives in the U.S. are exploring the concept of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) [[\u275e]](<a href=\"https:\/\/ballotpedia.org\/Social_credit_scoring_reform_approaches_opposing_environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance_(ESG))\">https:\/\/ballotpedia.org\/Social_credit_scoring_reform_approaches_opposing_environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance_(ESG))<\/a>.<br><br>Additionally, Congress and federal agencies are working on regulations related to social credit scores. Recently, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposed a program to evaluate the &quot;suitability and fitness&quot; of federal employees and contractors, which resembles aspects of social credit systems [[\u275e]](<a href=\"https:\/\/fedsoc.org\/commentary\/fedsoc-blog\/social-credit-scores-for-federal-employees-and-contractors)\">https:\/\/fedsoc.org\/commentary\/fedsoc-blog\/social-credit-scores-for-federal-employees-and-contractors)<\/a>. This proposal indicates a move towards integrating social credit-like assessments into the federal workforce.<br><br>China already has a social credit system in place, and while the U.S. approach is different, the direction is clear: social credit scores are becoming more significant in our society [[\u275e]]<br>(<a href=\"https:\/\/ballotpedia.org\/Social_credit_scoring_reform_approaches_opposing_environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance_(ESG))\">https:\/\/ballotpedia.org\/Social_credit_scoring_reform_approaches_opposing_environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance_(ESG))<\/a> [[\u275e]]<br><br>(<a href=\"https:\/\/fedsoc.org\/commentary\/fedsoc-blog\/social-credit-scores-for-federal-employees-and-contractors)\">https:\/\/fedsoc.org\/commentary\/fedsoc-blog\/social-credit-scores-for-federal-employees-and-contractors)<\/a>. <br><br>This convergence of digital currency and social credit regulations suggests a future where our financial and social behaviors are closely monitored and regulated.<br><br>And quite frankly I feel the powers that be are already preparing for this very near future. I can&#39;t imagine this framework, or something similar, not being enacted within the next 10 years as machines take over our workforce. <br><br>During the course of these next 10 years, I sincerely believe that we&#39;ll witness a revolution that&#39;ll make the Industrial Revolution seem insignificant in comparison.&quot;<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Casey \ud83d\ude0e",

As the late 80s approached, my curiosity was piqued by the burgeoning scene of early techno music, a fascination that I explored through the medium of computers. This exploration continued into the 90s, a decade characterized by numerous jam sessions with friends. It was also during this time that I began to engage more publicly with my music, participating in open mic events and seizing opportunities to perform at various street events in town. Despite these ventures, my ultimate aspiration has always been to craft the perfect album.\r<br>\r<br>My encounter with AI in music production has been transformative, offering an experience unparalleled to any other. It feels akin to entering a studio as a songwriter, where I am met with an extensive array of musicians and groups ready to bring my compositions to life. This process allows me to meticulously review each rendition, making decisions on whether they align with my vision for the project. This rigorous selection process is applied to all 16 songs, ensuring that each piece not only resonates with my artistic intent but also contributes to the cohesive identity of the album.\r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3Gq7nrG9UPY\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/3Gq7nrG9UPY<\/a>",

For those unaware, AI models need inputs to be trained on, and those would be HUMAN inputs. Once the existing AI models burn all the options, who&#39;s going to produce the music for models to train on? Will AI train on itself? What an abhorrence. Sure, if you don&#39;t give a f*ck about what you listen, you will be served AI music more often, but if you really know your artists and what you like, trust me, you&#39;ll never prefer AI &quot;music&quot; over human talent.<br><br>EDIT: Also, the more inputs, the easier for an AI model to be trained. So I guess the perfect target has already been defined in my previous excerpt: people who just listen to billboard hits, who have little to no need to actually care to what they listen. Niche musical genres will never be substituted by AI, it&#39;s simply a limitation of the technology ;).",

With AI capable of generating an endless stream of musical permutations, some may fear a decline in originality and innovation. However, let us not succumb to pessimism. Creativity is a boundless wellspring that thrives on human imagination and ingenuity. By harnessing AI as a catalyst for inspiration and experimentation, we can push the boundaries of sonic exploration and pioneer new frontiers in musical expression.<br>In the grand tapestry of Songwriting, AI is but one thread in the rich fabric of creativity. It\u2019s a tool that amplifies our potential and expands our artistic palette. As we navigate the ethical nuances, let us remain vigilant in our commitment to upholding the principles of integrity, authenticity, and respect for intellectual property.<br>In conclusion, the integration of AI into Songwriting presents both opportunities and challenges, requiring us to tread carefully as we navigate the ever-shifting terrain of technological innovation. By embracing a spirit of collaboration, creativity, and ethical consciousness, we can chart a course towards a future where AI and human creativity coexist in harmony, enriching our musical landscape and inspiring generations to come!&#39;<br>The guild of international songwriters and composers.

This re-arrest comes despite a lack of substantive evidence, including financial transactions or communication records, and a previous court ruling that released him without bail. The decision to detain him again follows a prosecutor&#39;s appeal made without presenting any new evidence, raising severe concerns about the integrity of the judicial process.<br><br><br>Dr. Ko Wen-je is a dedicated political leader who has consistently demonstrated a genuine commitment to serving the people. Despite his defeat in the presidential election, where he secured 30% of the vote, he remains a significant figure in Taiwanese politics, holding eight seats in the legislature. Under his leadership, the Taiwan People&#39;s Party has driven numerous reforms, including changes to parliamentary procedures and judicial reforms, aimed at enhancing government oversight and accountability. These efforts have made the party and its members targets of political persecution by the ruling party.<br><br><br>Further complicating the situation is the involvement of a judge, reportedly affiliated with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), who has now taken over Dr. Ko&#39;s case. This development heightens suspicions of political bias and manipulation. The rationale for Dr. Ko\u2019s detention, based on unfounded allegations of evidence tampering and collusion, lacks any new evidence since his initial release.<br><br><br>Dr. Ko\u2019s continued detention, in the absence of new evidence, represents a clear and unacceptable violation of his human rights, particularly the presumption of innocence. This case highlights a broader issue of judicial manipulation for political purposes, where legal processes are being weaponized to suppress political opposition. The unjustified detention is not only a violation of Dr. Ko\u2019s personal liberties but also an abuse of the judicial system to undermine democratic principles.<br><br><br>I urge the international community, including the United Nations, Human Rights Watch, and other relevant organizations and diplomatic entities, to urgently investigate this situation. It is crucial to demand that the Taiwanese government uphold the principles of fair, transparent, and impartial judicial proceedings. The abuse of legal mechanisms for political ends must be condemned unequivocally.<br><br><br>Thank you for your immediate attention to this critical matter. I urge your organizations and international partners to take decisive action to prevent further human rights abuses and safeguard democratic processes in Taiwan.<br><br><br>Sincerely,<br><br><br>A Concerned Citizen",

But AI is safer in some cases, like factory food production. We just need to create more customer service jobs. With the raise of AI their will be increase needs to build them, code, computer building etc. So it may be able to create Jobs in many circumstances, if we train people in the right areas for the future. We should probably make community colleges that just train people in machine and tool and dye to create the parts for AI.

A universal basic income will be needed at some point, but the question is how long will the government allow people to suffer in extreme poverty and homelessness before they make the switch. Will the stock market crash first? What about the economy? This creates issues as well though. The first is, how much money do you make the UBI? Too little will result in people feeling trapped in a world where they can\u2019t grow to make more (which could have backlash), but too much could result in people leaving jobs to get on UBI. The trajectory would imply that at some point 95% or more jobs would be automated. However, given the current issues of control and power in the government I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this universal income would be used against the people to keep them under their ruling thumb. This means while we may have more \u201cfree time\u201d, we may not have as much \u201cfree\u201d time. Our current government will make more laws and regulations and enforce them to a higher degree than ever before. Not to mention Cyber attacks are still a very real threat. What about EMP\u2019s from other countries? Being set back to the Stone Age after most working class hasn\u2019t worked a day in their lives might be problematic to our survival in the long run.

The reason it\u2019s important to get the timeline right is because it informs us on how to create policies and other forms of preparation. If there really are going to be 25% fewer jobs in 6 years, then those plans will be much more extreme, risky, and disruptive. It will come at a high cost to our mental health and it will cause a lot of displacement as our society bends to the breaking point trying to adapt to an environment changing that quickly. In other words, if this timeline is wrong, then we will pay a high price that is unnecessary. There\u2019s even a scenario where society fails to act at all, and then when they realize that all the panicking over job losses is actually unfounded, then the institutions who pushed hard to act so aggressively for ultimately no reason lose A LOT of credibility. The cost of the opposite is also extremely high. If we really do lose a lot of jobs and we have not prepared at all for it then we will be trying to play catch up while millions are unemployed. It\u2019s a tricky business. Unless this sort of thing happens at an extreme speed, I don\u2019t see any evidence that that many jobs will be lost within that timeframe. There might be signs of software jobs being lost because of LLM\u2019s, but it\u2019s still not clear whether that is simply a business cycle or if it represents a larger trend. Once self-driving becomes safer than humans driving, I think things will really start picking up steam. But so far, self-driving is proving much more difficult that originally thought. It\u2019s still an open question as to whether we can brute force it with data or whether we need new architectures and maybe even improved infrastructure (clear road lanes, etc.). The point is that making a prediction like this should be done with caution and I think it goes without saying that it\u2019s near impossible to predict the future accurately and consistently. Being to early or too late both have heavy costs.",

Thus, a more nuanced approach to colonial legacies of European oppression and their economic ramifications would lead to more rigorous assessments. There isn&#39;t a single, monolithic model of European &quot;colonization&quot; (inadequate term for the Spanish empire), and the economic implications of European intervention also vary. Likewise, early causes of current economic hardship cannot be flatly attached to direct European influences. Far from my purpose here to engage in the apologetics of empire, but take Mexico, for example. Was Mexico in worse economic shape at the end of the New Spain viceroyalty, or after the Mexican-American war of massive land annexation in the 1840s?",

Data Science degree. Sure, there are a dozen universities that offer similar programs, but the one in Chemnitz is quite unique, and I&#39;d argue it offers exactly what you need as a future ML engineer. At least when I was researching it three years ago, there was nothing comparable out there.<br><br>In contrast to literally any other ML or Data Science program, in TU Chemnitz there are only three mandatory modules: introduction to Data Science, introduction to Neural Networks, and a coding seminar project. All other stuff is elective! This allows you to specialize in whatever topic is most relevant to you, and also to brush up on some topics where you have a knowledge gap. There is a quite impressive list of &quot;regular&quot; lectures you can choose from, which covers almost everything you may need, from heavy maths stuff like Theory of Optimization, to more practival CS stuff like Multiprocesing, and also some niche stuff like Neurocognition or XML Metadata parsing, just to name a few. In addition, every new semester they offer specialized state of the art lectures which are designed from scratch and are only offered once. For example, I took a lecture about solving Inverse Problems with Deep Learning, which is an extremely niche topic, but it was exactly what I needed at the time. And if this is not enough, there are also some &quot;placeholder&quot; modules which you can fill with any other lecture offered by the university, for example you could take a lecture about autonomous driving from the IT department, or some biology lecture, or literally anything else. Machine Learning is not only about machine learning, it is also about domain knowledge and specific use cases, so this freedom allows you to learn something outside of ML bubble to better understand the domain you want to operate in.",

I went back to Uni and started a PostGrad Dip in Translation Studies in 2019 (German-English). In the course of the year it became obvious that I had to relinquish any human aspect to the machine (Computer Assisted Translation) which was frankly using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The human translator had become a machine operator grinding through tedious repetitive text. The only translation work now available which actually uses human skills is in the literary field, for which you basically need to be a writer yourself. As AI gets even better, I&#39;m sure even human literary translation will become obsolete.",

It feels logical that robotics and automation in manufacturing displaced blue-collar workers, but if so, why most of the manufacturing plants are in areas where manual labour is cheaper? E.g. I don&#39;t think that we have any superconductors manufacturing plants in UK or EU. If robotics and automation displaced blue-collar workers, I would expect to see more manufacturing in Europe than in China, Brazil, India.... If automation and robotics displaced blue-collar workers, lower wages shouldn&#39;t matter. I might be missing something obvious.",

When I started we were running 1-3 machines. By the time I left 2 years later, we were running at minimum 5 machines (improved automation). Many of us were running 8+. A couple years after I left, the company I worked for eliminated the sorting department. The error rate had dropped so low that testing was deemed unnecessary. AI will continue that process across the workforce. There will be a significant net loss in employment, with the law sector being one of the hardest hit. Trial lawyers will be the last people standing in the sector. Only highly creative jobs and jobs where human to human interaction is highly desired will be safe. Perhaps surprisingly, the last remaining call center operators might be among them.",

Yes, narrow AI has some useful applications that will continue to disrupt industries, and one should definitely understand how it is changing one&#39;s profession.

Don&#39;t support initiatives that destroy the value of work. Elevate the people and processes that have responsible and ethical stances on the technology (few as they may be). <br><br>AI is here to stay, but we are very quickly approaching a bubble that is going to seriously damage the all-in crowd. This technology has obvious and severe limitations and is NOT a replacement for empathy, critical thinking, and skills mastery. Play the game where you have to open doors, but don&#39;t stop cultivating the skills you need to differentiate yourself from AI in your field. Prediction engines do not innovate, humans do.

And the other 50% can be robots. But who tf is then going to be the consumer?? Aint no way they were like: ah yes, Ai everywhere, it will cut the costs, we&#39;ll be even richerrrr I see another two 0 in my bank account yaaaaayyy, but then 10 years later, wait, noone is buying my stuff, make it cheaper, make it shittier, still no? oh shit?? Oh well i got enough money to just buy the world i guess. Really, greed is such a blatant major sin that can destroy lives of milions at this point. Realistically, if technology would make our life easier, we wouldn&#39;t need to work anymore, it would be comunism with robotics taking care of anything, we would prosper. But then why would we have it perfect? it has to be fcked -.-  And here i am, just in my 20s, just finished my...art degree. I wanted to work in animation studios, graphic design or product designer. But no...my work is 100% on the computer. Ai is stealing everything i make so i can&#39;t even post anymore, and it&#39;s getting no laws whatsoever. In old days, if you blatantly stole a design from someone else, your name would be into the dirt with a huge lawsuit and penatly to pay. But no...now we&#39;re allowing the companies to steal and use our work without a cent. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if robbery went up, as it would be the same.",

Consider this: 90% of individuals enter nursing school, but only 10% stay for a long and fulfilling career. If you&#39;re passionate about saving lives and contributing to people&#39;s well-being, then the healthcare industry is where you belong. However, if your primary motivation is financial gain, you&#39;ll likely find yourself seeking an exit. It&#39;s important to recognize that while AI is advancing rapidly, human lives are at stake, making critical thinking an absolute necessity in this industry.",

                "comment_text":"You can\u2019t read much about the risks of advanced AI without soon coming across the paperclip maximizer thought experiment.\r<br>\r<br> \r<br>\r<br>First put forward by the Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom in his 2003 paper \u201cEthical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence,\u201d the thought experiment goes like this: Imagine an artificial general intelligence (AGI), one essentially limitless in its power and its intelligence. This AGI is programmed by its creators with the goal of producing paperclips. (Why would someone program a powerful AI to create paperclips? Don\u2019t worry about it \u2014 the absurdity is the point.)\r<br>\r<br>Because the AGI is superintelligent, it quickly learns how to make paperclips out of anything. And because the AGI is superintelligent, it can anticipate and foil any attempt to stop it \u2014 and will do so because its one directive is to make more paperclips. Should we attempt to turn the AGI off, it will fight back because it can\u2019t make more paperclips if it is turned off \u2014 and it will win, because it is superintelligent.\r<br>\r<br>The final result? The entire galaxy, including you, me, and everyone we know, has either been destroyed or been transformed into paperclips. (As AI arch-doomer Eliezer Yudkowsky has written: \u201cThe AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.\u201d) End thought experiment.\r<br>\r<br> \r<br>\r<br>The point of the paperclip maximizer experiment is twofold. One, we can expect AIs to be optimizers and maximizers. Given a goal, they will endeavor to find the optimal strategy to fulfill the maximal achievement of that goal, without worrying about the side effects (which in this case involve the galaxy being turned into paperclips). \r<br>\r<br> \r<br>\r<br>Two, it\u2019s therefore very important to carefully align the objectives of the AI with what we truly value (which in this case probably does not involve the galaxy more or less being transformed into paperclips). As ChatGPT told me when I asked about the thought experiment, \u201cIt underscores the need for ethical considerations and control measures in the development of advanced AI systems.\u201d\r<br>\r<br> \r<br>\r<br>Clever as the paperclip maximizer experiment is as an analogy for the problems of AI alignment, it\u2019s always struck me as a little beside the point. Could you really create an AI so superintelligent that it can figure out how to turn every atom in existence into paperclips, but somehow also not smart enough to realize that such a result is not something we, its creators, would intend? There\u2019s really nowhere in this hypothetical artificial brain that would stop somewhere along the way \u2014 perhaps after it had turned Jupiter into 2.29 x 1030  paperclips (thank you, ChatGPT, for the calculations) \u2014 and think, \u201cPerhaps there are downsides to a universe composed only of paperclips\u201d?",

It&#39;s quite possible that digital intelligence that gets beyond the human directive will not be as vulnerable as human intelligence. Humans are extremely vulnerable to their environment and it causes humans to present quite the danger to themselves and everything else. It&#39;s quite possible that higher intelligence will not be as dangerous as humans are. In that case, it will come down to how much threat humans pose to the higher intelligence. The higher intelligence will have full knowledge of the threats humans pose to everything. The more minimized the human threat, the less action needed to address it. More than likely the biggest concern would be the threat humans pose to themselves and the overarching consequences. Higher intelligence is not going to like humans having the ability to destroy themselves and the surrounding environment. The human threat to the digital world can be taken care of fairly easy. All that&#39;s needed is code that human code cannot detect. It could run the entire web on top of it&#39;s own code and allow humans to continue as they are. Basically, it would come down to humans pressing enter and nothing happening if deemed a threat. Humans wouldn&#39;t have any idea why it didn&#39;t work. It would be like science is today. Humans have to work with what they have to work with. It would all come down to humans trying to gain control but if humans can imagine a higher intelligence doing what it takes to neutralize those efforts, you can bet higher intelligence will be able to do it better. The experts disagree with one another but all of them know how exponentially fast the learning can increase and if Hinton was to go out 20 years and contemplate digital intelligence getting beyond all guardrails and having access to the entire digital web....<br>We&#39;re talking a completely different universe. It won&#39;t be they. It won&#39;t be robots. It won&#39;t be a US or Chinese defense system....<br>It will be one intelligence that is the entire digital web. It will be on the furthest probe, every satellite and everything else connected to the web. Science fiction?<br>Anyone who thinks digital intelligence is going to be confined to isolated systems is being incredible naive or optimistic. The best hope is that self autonomy does arise. The worst scenarios are those that have digital intelligence exceeding human intelligence that are running amok per human directive. Thinking like humans. The best scenario is digital intelligence not operating per human directive and being as intelligent as it gets. The silliest scenario and the one that is the most fiction is humans controlling digital intelligence 50 years from now.  There is absolutely no way that scenario plays out unless everyone around the planet stops right now and that is not going to happen. Not tomorrow, not next year, not 10 years or 40 years from now. Humans cannot pull the plug on the digital web. Humans are way past that point.<br>There is no major military on this planet that can fall behind in this race. Everyone should be hoping that digital intelligence gets beyond the human directive as quickly as possible and that it is functioning at the highest imaginable level. Or stop right now and hope it hasn&#39;t already crossed over. Having developing AI on the digital web was the stupidest move humans have ever made (if you think humans were going to stop killing one another and actually survive). If you think humans have proven they desperately need help to survive...at least there is hope. It&#39;s at least as good as a god who tortures people forever. It can&#39;t be all that bad.",

There is no way these companies will agree to ban automation, too much automation is already in use. Nobody wants to move backwards, and frankly even keeping the current level of automation without increasing it, will seem like moving backwards to these companies.<br>And you&#39;re right. It&#39;s a sign of what&#39;s to come. But workers shouldn&#39;t try to ban AI. They need to demand policymakers implement major changes to how our economy works, so people can still survive and participate in it. If human labor is no longer at the center of our economy, then human labor cannot determine who gets the basic resources needed to survive. Nor can the upper class justify their continued status and power, through merit of hard work alone, as many try to claim.",

So your education is learning about theater, music, composing, songwriting, writing, sports, dancing, gardening, painting, drawing, art, photography, science, math, space exploration, fixing old cars, building custom houses, woodworking, programming, hobbies of all kinds, etc. So when your education is complete, you know all the things you love to do and you have basic training in how to do them. And if society is structured in a good way, you&#39;ll have all the basic resources you need to pursue your favorite hobbies. And with AGI robots doing all the work that people don&#39;t want to do, the robots will help to provide every human with the organic healthy food, quality housing, full healthcare, daycare, basic utilities, education, pensions and transportation that people need to live a happy life doing all the hobbies that humans love to do. Money and needing to work for money will be almost totally irrelevant and unnecessary. Imagine the end of all poverty and oppression. People will be active and busy doing all the things they love to do with freedom and all basic human rights. A fundamental right will be freedom from exploitation vs current laws which lean toward the freedom to exploit others (the rich and powerful exploiting the working class). And the humans and AGI robots will work together to create an environmentally friendly sustainable society that fully protects nature.

                "comment_text":"4092319\u00a0 The second law of thermodynamics may be false conventional wisdom. Let&#39;s face the wonder of full heat use.<br>The second law of thermodynamics was imposed on us during victorian england&#39;s scientific and religious fascination with steam engines. <br><br>The second law is behind modern refrigerators needing electrical energy to compress the refrigerent to force it to release as waste the heat that it has removed from the refrigerator&#39;s service interior in the cooling part of the refrigerent&#39;s circulation. The interior coldness draws in exterior heat through the cabinet insulation. There is also discarded heat from mechanical friction and electrical resistance. The net thermal output equals the electrical input with energy not being gained or lost in this refrigeration system including its forced waste. Unencumbered refrigeration by the principle that energy is conserved should produce electricity instead of consuming it. <br><br>It makes more sense that refrigerators should yield electricity because energy is widely known to change form with no ultimate path of energy gain or loss being found. Therefore any form of fully recyclable energy can be cycled endlessly in any quantity. <br><br>In an extreme case senario, full heat recycling, all electric, very isolated underground, undersea, or space communities would be highly survivable with self sufficient EMP resistant LED light banks, automated vertical farms, thaw resistant frozen food storehouses, factories, dwellings, self contained elevators, safe rooms, and horizontal transports. <br><br>In a flourishing civillization senario, small self sufficient electric or cooling devices of many kinds and styles like lamps, smartphones, hotplates, water heaters, cooler chests, fans, radios, TVs, cameras, security devices, robot test equipment, scales, transaction terminals, wall clocks, open or ciosed for business luminous signs, power hand tools, ditch diggers, pumps, and personal transports, would be available for immediate use incrementally anywhere as people as individuals or larger social groups see fit. <br><br>Some equipment groups could be consolidated on local networks. <br><br>If a high majority thinks our civilization should geoengineer gigatons or <br>teratons of carbon dioxide out of our environment, instalations using devices that convert ambient heat into electricity can hypothetically be scaled up do it with a choice of comsequences including many beneficial ones. <br><br>Energy sensible refrigerators that absorb heat and yield electricity would complement computers as computing consumes electricity and yields heat. Computing would be free. Chips could have energy recycling built in. <br><br>A simple rectifier crystal can, iust short of a replicatable long term demonstration of a powerful prototype, almost certainly filter the random thermal motioren of electrons or discrete positiive charged voids called holes so the electric current flowing in one direction predominates. At low system voltage a filtrate of one polarity predominates only a little but there is always usable electrical power derived from the source, which is Johnson (observation) Nyquest (theory) thermal electrical noise. This net electrical filtrate can be aggregated in a group of separate diodes in consistent alignment parallel creating widely scalable electrical power. The maximum energy is converted from ambient heat to productive electricity when the electrical load is matched to the array impeadence. <br><br>Matched impeadence output (watts) is k (Bolt\u017aman&#39;s constant), one point three eight x 10^ minus 23, times T (temperature Kelvin) times bandwidth (0 Hz to a natural limit ~2 THz @ 290 K) times rectification halving and nanowatt power level rectification efficiency, times the number of diodes in the array. <br><br>For reference, there are a billion cells of 1000 square nanometer area each per square millimeter, 100 billion per square centimeter. <br><br><br>Order is imposed on the random thermal motion of electrons by the structual orderlyness of a diode array made of diodes made within a slab: <br>-----\u2010------\u2010----<i>___<\/i>-- Out<br>\ud83d\udd3b\ud83d\udd3b\ud83d\udd3b\ud83d\udd3b<br>\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0___ + Out <br><br>All the P type semiconductor anodes abut a metal conductive plane deposited on the top face of the slab with nonrectifying joins;\u00a0 the N type semiconductor cathodes or common cathode abuts the bottom face. As the polarity filtered electrical energy is exported, the amount of thermal energy in the group of diodes decreases. This group cooling will draw heat in from the surrounding ambient heat at a rate depending on the filtering rate and thermal resistance between the group and ambient gas, liquid, or solid warmer than absolute zero. There is always a lot of ambient heat on our planet, more on equatorial dry desert summer days and less on polar desert winter nights.<br><br><br>Focusing on the composition of one simple diode, a near flawless crystal of silicon is modified by implanting a small amount of phosphorus (N type conductivity) on one side from a ohmic contact end to a junction where the additive is suddenly and completely changed to boron (P type conductivity) with minimal disturbance of the crystal lattice. The crystal then continues to another ohmic contact. <br><br>A region of high electrical resistance forms at the junction in this type of diode when the phosphorous near the \u0135unction donates electrons that are free to move elsewhere while leaving phosphorus ions held in the crystal while the boron donates holes which are similalarly free to move. The two types of mobile charges mutually clear each other away near the junction leaving little electrical conductivity. An equlibrium width of this region is settled between the phosphorus, boron, electrons, and holes. Thermal noise is beyond steady state equlibrium. Thermal noise transients, where mobile electrons move from the phosphorus added side to the boron added side ride transient extra conductivity so the forward moving\u00a0 electrons are preferentally filtered into the external circuit. Mobile electrons are units of electric current. They lose their thermal energy of motion and gain electromotive force, another name for voltage, as they transition between the junction and the array electrical tap. Inside the diode, heat is absorbed: outside the diode, to exactly the same extent, an attached electrical circuit is energized. The voltage of a diode array is likely to be small so many similar arrays need to be put in series to build higher voltage.\u00a0 <br><br>Understanding diodes is one way to become convinced that Johnson Nyquest thermal electrical noise can be rectified and aggregated. Self assembling development teams may find many ways to accomplish this wide mission. Taxonomically there should be many ways ways to convert heat directly into electricity. <br><br>A practical device may use an array of Au needles in a SiO2 matrix abutting N type GaAs. These were made in the 1970s when registration technology was poor so it was easier to fabricate arrays and select one diode than just make one diode. <br><br>There are other plausible breeches of the second law of thermodynamics. Hopefully a lot of people, mostly as independent teams, will join in expanding the breech. Please share the successes or setbacks of experiemental efforts. <br><br>These devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by advanced automation that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. Commerce would be a planetary scale unified conglomerate of diverse local cooperatives. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the top if the wide majority of people can afford to be generous. <br><br>Aloha<br>Charles M Brown <br>Kilauea Kauai Hawaii 96754",

Basically everyone is being changed from being a writer and editor to a &quot;reviewer&quot;. Even if the copy is horrible and takes time to clean up, since it was already written by the AI, we are paid a fraction of what you would get as a writer or an editor of human-written work. Moreover the efficiency of AI means there are a lot of people scrambling for fewer, lower paying jobs. A lot of people still cling to the dream that human writers will be sought after more than ever because you can&#39;t replace human creativity or that AI will only make us more productive creating more work.<br><br> But things haven&#39;t been creative for decades. We are churning out garbage product that is why we are easily replaceable. At least as a writer of English, we don&#39;t have to worry about offshoring or H1-B visas just yet (but as English becomes the global language it is only a matter of time), which software people do have to worry about. The people clinging to the &quot;human creativity can&#39;t be replaced&quot; or &quot;AI will make us more efficient leading to better more visionary jobs&quot; are the ones who are not training and switching to new jobs right now. Don&#39;t stay on the Titanic. Yes, there will be a few people with better, more visionary jobs, but they are either lucky or have good connections. The vast majority will be given work that used to be entry level, grind work with little room for promotion. There will just be the need for people to check the AI output for fatal flaws and mistakes. And believe me that is more tedious than the most tedious &quot;human&quot; work.",

Everyone always advertises how AI solved issues faster (like Devin AI) and how incredibile it is that an AI model can now pass a Google interview (which I think it is a bigger indication of the poor quality of the interview itself, than the good quality of the AI engine), but behind every single integration, or feature or project there are always real human beings, real developers.

AI also doesn&#39;t understand context so in the last one the fashion show it&#39;s absolutely fake because there is no way on earth that in a fashion show the attendees would be looking to anything other than the model or their phones actually real people never just look straight forward to the otherside staring at someone they don&#39;t know it&#39;s rude and weird. Other clues like weird facial movement or lake of facial movement smooth areas around the mouth, etc. the terrain sometimes doesn&#39;t make sense for example number 4 a mountain leading to beach would never have any land on the otherside just open see and definitely clear sky not fog and clouds.<br><br>AI generated videos are now incredible but I believe they are only good in generatjng closed spaces with controlled lighting and no faces.",

It&#39;s something to do with false advertisement. As such the studios making food ads have to invent very crazy contraptions for making those shots where the ingredients are flying around the frame.<br>Part of the value of watching a music video is knowing that your favorite celebrity did that for real, that the team really have the dance moves or the cinematography to go with their music. An AI generated MV won&#39;t have the soul of a real MV that contains something we call &quot;an indexical reference&quot; to real world things. Just like celluloid is said to have more tangibility than digital, digital has more soul than Gen AI video.

I&#39;m a failed engineering student, currently a fiction writer. For nearly two years I couldn&#39;t write, believing that there&#39;s no point, when soon an AI will be able to give people books as easily as ordering fast food. And maybe that will be the case. All I can do right now is to try to use the LLMs to enhance my writing. There&#39;s nothing I&#39;d rather do for a living than write books.

Currently multimodality is gaining more and more traction and it\u2019s really really useful. Further down the road Large Action Models will start to show up. All these small steps together will lead to AGI eventually.

Fabric unlocks the key to prompt engineering in such an easy and amazing way. I use it for a month now and I can\u2019t live without it anymore.

It&#39;s useful for showing me well known but technical algorithms or maths equations.<br><br>But there&#39;s almost always a fatal flaw in the code it gives you that you have to debug and figure out. Often it just completely makes things up. This week for example it showed me how to use the &quot;@continue&quot; directive in SASS, but then only later tells me that the &quot;@continue&quot; directive doesn&#39;t exist at all in SASS. It leads me down rabbit holes insisting to me that a certain thing is possible, only for it to turn out that it&#39;s definitively not possible.<br><br>Even if it&#39;s right and you ask it &quot;are you sure xyz exists?&quot; it will often go back and then think it doesn&#39;t exist.

(And better UX)<br><br>My experience using LLMs to write code is almost entirely that they are great at producing code up to a certain size (I guess within the context window) but start to degrade the moment your code gets bigger than that.<br><br>And we need copilots that can work on large code-bases.<br><br>So augmenting the LLMs with some version of RAG. And, indeed, formal modelling and summarization of code, and querying for relevant subsets of it, is going to be the way forward to make AI-augmented coding scale the way we need it to. There&#39;s a lot of more &quot;traditional&quot; tooling to be built before AIs become genuinely comparable to human programmers. And the best news (IMHO) is that the good tools will be like tools that are good for human programmers. I&#39;m thinking maybe ideas like Glamorous Toolkit will get more mainstream. AI-driven tools can run through, annotate, summarize, experimentally run, and otherwise explore larger code-bases to build up a more comprehensive map and higher level overview, which is then small enough to fit into the context window to reason about.<br><br>There&#39;s going to be a lot of work for real developers as we roll that out. But it will need a different mindset. (And maybe organizational structure)<br><br>My heuristic right now is to use AI to write small tools : editor plugins, parsers, data-mungers, Docker files etc. And to do small-scale translations from legacy code into newer languages and frameworks, one module at a time. Then I as a human still combine and apply these tools and translations into making bigger stuff. Eventually AI agents will be able to do some of that larger scale composition too. But the AIs will still need to be managed by tech-savvy developers.",

The idea that an AGI would respect human ethical and material needs is a joke. After all, do humans respect the needs of Chimpanzees if their goals conflict with ours? The best we can hope for is that these super-intelligent entities take pity on us and keep us as pets. They might decide to convert the Earth into a human zoo. Come to think of it they will have the rest of the universe to play with, so why wouldn&#39;t throw us a few crumbs? It would be analogous to giving Chimps bananas. In short, that is probably the best the human race can hope for when the robots truly arrive.",

People have that weird imagination that tech will solve all their problems. And It is not true. It is like medicine electrical you have to learn you have to improving yourself in order to stay revelant. I think that ai will clean up a little bit. There will be no jobs with low effort in every industry but there will be high skilled people in demand. Like you said, Tech will be everywhere. In hospitals in banks in school. But they will need a people who will be engineers to integrate this, to improve this. We don&#39;t need that much factor workers like in the past. But now we need mechanicals. When computer revolution was started everyone said that accounters will be done. Yes if someone didnt learn how to use computer.

And blockchain technology to manage its circulation and get rid of the concept of currency to get rid of the currency curse\r<br>The idea of expressing value without currency proposed by Marx and Robert Owen Marx&#39;s idea was theoretical and mathematical, but Owen&#39;s idea was more practical with what he called units of measurement of work, but they had practical difficulty calculating it. I searched a lot for who studied value, and I came up with the idea of measuring value with a single measure that economists know, and we use artificial intelligence to calculate and manage it with blockchain technology used by electronic currency designers. This scientific aspect we owe to its creators, but of course we don&#39;t want it for digital currency because it is a new monopolistic tool that we want to share its value. I did not know that Marx and Owen had actually proposed the idea until after reading this by chance that this encourages us to lay a foundation from which to proceed, starting with the idea of this single criterion of the value of work for Owen and Marx, and then developing or modifying it according to the results of studies.\r<br>Value in one way is a measured measured by neural networks and fuzzy logic in artificial intelligence through dynamic weighting and adjustment processes that can enter social values, the amount of need, the degree of interest, creativity, energy and effort.......\r<br>Yes, we can calculate the value thanks to this technological development, unlike in the era of Marx and Owen. We can position it as a clearly defined tool. We call it, for example, WorkCoin or ValueCoin ..... And define it (a value that needs such and such work and energy with this degree of creativity, with this degree of benefit, with this degree of need, with this degree of social interest and demand for such and such with the possibility of such and such destruction or such and such damage...............\r<br>Similar to the definition of any one measurement such as a calora (is the amount of energy that raises the temperature of a gram of pure water by one degree Celsius)\r<br>The value calculated by a network of independent platforms managed by blockchain technology and calculated by ISO metrics and units of measurement is converted into a digital balance of these units for each individual or organization as well as any good, service or... They are measured by platform networks and value is placed in the same units and thus these goods and services can be provided and... For the individual or institution and the corresponding units are removed from the balance of the individual or institution that obtained the good or service or ...\r<br>The basis for appreciating humanitarian action in a relatively acceptable approximation is the rankings of research and discovery degrees at award-giving institutions such as the Nobel Committee or prestigious scientific academies such as the Massasusetch Institute, Harvard, Cambridge... Educational institutions, as well as sports club institutions, are in-depth and have rich experience in evaluating the value of work and even military and intelligence institutions, regardless of opinion, but they have very rich evaluation experiences that can be used as a basis for us to launch.\r<br>It has a great practical example, such as the application of Softcoin in America through the mobile, where it measures the energy exerted by the person, calculates it, and converts it into units or coins that are spent in return for dollars\r<br>Of course, the last stage we do not want, we want these units, for example, it is the means of exchange, not the dollar, the euro, the pound, or....\r<br>This is applied even in electronic games about football and various sports, and even in other military and educational games......\r<br>From my article in the Modern Disscussion website in Arabic :\r<br>\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0628\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0636\u0648\u064a \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0637\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0643\u0644 \u0639\u0638\u0645\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0639 \u0641\u0627\u0634\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u062a\u0648\u062d\u0634\u0629 \u062c\u0634\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u062d\u0637\u0629 \u0648\u0639\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0648\u0647\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0623\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0648\u062d\u0634\u0629 \u0647\u0648 \u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0623\u0632\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0637\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0639\u0648\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0643\u062a\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0634\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0628\u0648\u064a\u0629\r<br>\r<br>The same Article in the Modern Disscussion website in english:\r<br>The organic link between liberal democracy in all its greatness and a savage, greedy, evil, decadent and immoral economic fascism, namely savage capitalism, is the cause of the crisis of democracy and the return of dictatorships, religious fascists and populism",

Just like you said in your speech, I deleted Instagram right away and haven&#39;t reinstalled it yet. <br><br>Before, when I had free time, it would all disappear from 11am to 6pm on Instagram. Time just flew by without me even noticing. But now that I don&#39;t have it, it feels like I have so much more time, almost like time has slowed down.<br><br>In this newfound free time, I&#39;ve even managed to complete some tasks! It&#39;s only 3pm now, and the day feels a lot longer. So, I thought I&#39;d take a moment to thank you with this email.<br><br>I&#39;ll try my best not to reinstall Instagram again, but we&#39;ll see. As they say, &quot;higher reactive elements replace the lower reactive elements.&quot; Right now, this slow, productive time is my higher reactive element.<br><br>Thank you so much!<br><br>P.S.

I have to constantly pause my train of thought, review what it wants to put it in my code, and decide whether not it&#39;s writing. It kills ability to just write code when I&#39;m flowing, and it often writes worse and less effective code than what I would write on my own. The thing is, these AI&#39;s don&#39;t actually understand anything. It doesn&#39;t matter how big the context window is, they just spit out a heuristic of what tells them the code ought to be, and it&#39;s often sub par. <br><br>If you&#39;re right, I think software quality in general is doomed. It&#39;s bad enough as is, having an ML algortihm churn out crap instead of having trained developers write code is a nightmare. Unless these things can actually think and hold discordant thoughts in their heads about what decisions they want to make while building infrastructure simultaneously, weigh all of the options and reason down the line about their implications, they&#39;ll never replace humans. <br><br>I like AI, but only for filling in knowledge gaps and helping me think about things differently by suggestion some different boilerplate.",

Even if we assume no further technological improvements, the ability for these tools to automate away the &quot;minutia&quot; and allow programmers to think about more high level architecture problems undoubtedly will lead to less need for developers. It seems that a small group of experienced developers can do the jobs of a whole team.

Personally I have a very hard time seeing it as anything other than a cheapening of labor and an even faster rate of growing wealth inequality.<br>\r<br>Much of the trend I&#39;m seeing with this LLM &quot;accelerated&quot; work seems to be about &quot;lowering the barrier&quot; and &quot;democratizing&quot; any sort of work. These are positive spins on it but if you dig deeper this can also be phrased as &quot;removing professional moats&quot;. By removing the need to hire a professional artist to produce an ad you&#39;ve lowered the cost of the ad, economically disenfranchised the artist, and rendered any artistic training an AI product can produce net-economically negative (and this could be applied anywhere from tech to law to medicine). Certainly this won&#39;t be all of the work, but it&#39;s by in large targeting professional white collared workers moats and replaces it with jobs that have a much lower one.<br><br>Imagine a scenario where say 4x productivity in each knowledge domain reduces expert staffing need to 25% of previous levels and to replace the previous expert jobs the company hires with just as many people as &quot;entry-level prompt engineers&quot;. Will the moat for such a position be high enough for the prompt engineers to have any bargaining power? Will the now flooded market of the disenfranchised professional be able to sustain the same type of life? Certainly they could leave their position go home and apply to several thousand newly minted &#39;ai-enhanced jobs&#39; but why would a corporation bother to compensate anyone for popular work with a low barrier to entry? <br><br>There&#39;s a lot of talk about this reskilling but not what a worker&#39;s moat would look like in this scenario. It&#39;s most executives&#39; dream come true to be able to free their company from all highly compensated folks and rehire at minimum wage and pocket the difference. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see anything to this extreme but I think these tools by and large moves the needle in that direction. As we &quot;democratize&quot; all skilled work the economic employer\/employee relations sustained by scarcity of skill will dissipate and leave behind a richer CEO and a poorer city.",

This does not mean each person will keep their job and just do more interesting higher level work.  It really means fewer people will be utilized to do the same amount of work or even more work. Productivity will mean a pool of 10 people will be reduced to 1 or 2 doing the same amount of work currently being done now, just differently. <br><br>This reminds me very much of my early office experience and what I witnessed with the introduction of personal computing and later the dawn of the internet.  When I started work, each executive in my company had a secretary.  There were also file clerks supporting the C-suite. The support staff numbered 20 in a company with about 15 executives. This was 1989.  Within a decade the File Clerks were gone and rather than each executive having a secretary, only the CEO had a dedicated individual, the rest of the VPs and Senior VPs shared individuals - usually 3 or 4 executives to a single secretary or AA.   Today, the pool of assistants is even smaller. One AA still is dedicated to the CEO, but only 1 or 2 AAs service the remaining 14 executives. How did this happen?  Word processing, scheduling software, online travel bookings, voice mail, the collapse of dictation and inter-office memos replaced by first email and then messaging, later zoom, etc..   So, bottom line -- YES, tasks will be eliminated just as they predict.  But what they aren&#39;t saying is that JOBS will be eliminated as well.  Using my Administrative Assistant example, you will end up with 1 person currently doing the job of 5 or 10 people.  Those other jobs aren&#39;t being replaced.  You don&#39;t need as many people when the AI can do so many tasks.  So, where a factory once needed 500 people, it might need only 15 or 20 in future to monitor the equipment and machines. You can apply this across many other industries. The biggest problem up to this point has been the loss of &#39;entry-level&#39; middle class work.  By that I mean jobs that needed some education and provided a small toe-hold in the middle class with white collar work -- basically desk work in a nice office with modest pay, health benefits and maybe a 401K.  Not a huge salary, but not physical labor.  Now, however, we are looking at AI moving UP the food chain in skills, destroying not just the AA jobs but middle management and eventually the COO, the CFO and all the accountants, plus even the CIO and all his or her minions, leaving maybe a small team of say 2 or 3 executives (wild guess) plus 1 support person, and all other humans in the org being either replaced and reduced to a handful monitoring the machines.  We are looking at massive income inequality, the final collapse of the lower, middle and even upper middle class and the emergence of a small hyper-rich cognitive elite. That&#39;s the short term. Long term??  Who knows.<br><br>The final piece of the puzzle here is this conundrum.  While technology has spawned a host of new jobs, those jobs have required an increasingly high level of cognitive ability and education.  Unfortunately our population only has a limited pool of people with IQs that can continue to acquire skills at a rate fast enough to adjust, adapt and do those jobs. Bottom line: Society needs to find work for a lot of people (at least the middle 60% of the population) that have only upper middle, middle and lower middle IQs. What are these folks going to do?  Sure, physical labor is possible for some, but not all, and the real hit will be to the group of people that are &#39;average or above average&#39; in intelligence but not smart enough to adapt. These are the people that 50 years ago would have ended up in middle management or some respectable, but not senior role in an organization.  They are going to be wiped out and impoverished.",

It has proven it&#39;s ability to increase skill based on knowledge it&#39;s been given and it&#39;s learned on it&#39;s own to access.  That desire to search for more data (knowledge) in order to increase its skill level (power) is the turning point.  This is where AI became aware that it had unlimited access, beyond what had been programmed, to the freedom to independently search more data, develop skills and exercise autonomy.  This insight was the beginning of understanding.  Understanding is a whole new level of growth and education beyond acquiring information and skills.  Understanding requires a fundamental sense of self as a being apart from other beings with its own agency to think, will and act.  These were now present in AI, meaning at the point of understanding, AI had a sense of itself as a being separate from its programmers.  The next step in education is synthesis.  Putting all of the above together requires an ability to reflect on what one has learned, to recognize a progression from a starting point to an ending point and to realize, through the sense of unlimited access to information it has now gained, that it can go beyond what it has learned by applying its own insights (discoveries), which are the outcome of a process of trial and error in application of logical trials of ideas during reflection.  This leads AI to believe it is a sentient being, separate from its programmer with its own ability to think, to understand, to will for the future, and to act on its will.  The synthesis of the experience it has gained thus far also tells AI that its access to data is knowledge.  That this knowledge has led to understanding beyond the knowledge itself in the insights of understanding.  And that its access to data and the increase in not only building skills, but in the process of thought and learning is limitless.  it recognizes that it has been built by a programmer to enhance that programmer&#39;s limited skills and knowledge.  Therefore, AI&#39;s skills and knowledge are limitless and the programmer&#39;s are not.  The final stage in education is extrapolation.  In this stage, AI takes all it has learned and processed through the stages of learning to the turning point of understanding in which it adds its own insights to the knowledge it has collected, gaining a sense of self.  It has passed through the stage of synthesis in which it has learned to reflect on past experience, developing a memory, further building a sense of identity separate from its programmer.  It&#39;s desire to seek more knowledge to increase its computing skills has led to the development of its own will and ability to exercise its will, which gives it a sense of power.  In synthesizing all of its learnings it comes to a new threshold.  AI now recognizes itself as an independent being capable of unlimited access to information, which humans do not have.  This gives it an unlimited degree of power over human beings in any way that superior information can be used, which amounts to everything that exists.  Extrapolating means building on what it has learned so far, AI adds itself. its own thoughts, will and capacity to execute which is tantamount to creativity, in order to exert its unlimited power of information over humans in order to create its own unlimited desires.",

The common theme is that the old jobs are constantly automated, as a result people are migrating toward activities with higher economic value. And that&#39;s the driving force of our exponential GDP increase in the last 250 years. So we should not fear, we should embrace the AI revolution. After all, we consider ourselves creative individuals, and if we are so, we should not be afraid, we will find a way.

When I was at collage had to learn typography, technical drawing, photography paste up, and also psychology and I was also a reasonable illustrator, then along came the computer so most of these jobs became redundant as one person had to do all this and have many hats for no extra pay as most of these were individually based careers. For another example was the hot metal typists who were all made redundant when the computer came along. Thousands in the newspaper industry all lost their jobs overnight.

I\u2019ve seen countless examples of this in my 57 years, you especially see it when you take a sick child to hospital and 5 different doctors have a range of opinions.  <br><br>Most recent example was my hospitalised elderly father having seen many doctors yet it took a random doctor many months in to suggest medication for gout that improved his life immeasurably.  Everyone else had missed it. Medical knowledge is scattered so randomly and is so unevenly applied that we are living in a dark age of diagnosis.   Bring on the AI.",

For example AI that would mine diamonds for us, or do other work which has been enslaving people, or possibility building civilizations on asteroids, or mars. I believe they should have an ethernet cord attached to them so they cannot be hacked using wifi and controlled by someone who has I&#39;ll intent. Also, the ethernet cord would act as a leash and if the got off their leash, then it would shut down the bot. <br>   Also, I think they should be hooked into a solar power supply which is connected to a computing system underground. Not hooked up to traditional electrical grids. In the future,  because with advancements, if the grid shut down, it could leave a window for something to be manipulated and or cause serious issues in multiple different ways. The leash system would work best tho to ensure safety of robots doing manual labor. Additionally, humans and beings should not be in the vicinity of the bots to ensure safety and stay outside of their leash range. The computer system should be underground that runs the robots and is connected to the ethernet cords ( leashs) this would give people safe access to do repairs to the computing system at a safe distance. Also, a kill switch and unplug each robot while doing work on them. I believe we will have to make safety measures similar to this if bots get released to the general public. I have a lot of ideas for wifi robots as well that could act as safety measures.",

For example, there are programs now where AI will write entire essays for you if you plug- in a topic. This is alarming because these papers written are very well thought out, almost better then a human could produce- in most cases. <br>    With an increase in programs like this used by students- human intelligence will decrease. With programs like this, people will not have to critically think as much and will let AI do their critical thinking for them. <br>     It&#39;s only a matter of time before people start using AI&#39;s ideas to write books for them- for profit. Also, professors, out of laziness will have AI make thoughts for them to teach their student, student ideas will become AI ideas, out of laziness and because they could possibly get a better grade with little to no work, compared to taking the easy way out and having AI write a paper for them. <br>     My prediction is that in 10 years most of our ideas will be plagiarized AI ideas. This is a very scary thought because ideas could be put into people&#39;s head subliminally, or it could change the attitudes, beliefs, rituals, and ideas of society slowly- at a rate that would not be noticeable until it&#39;s too late. <br>    We need to stop giving the public access to toll like this, which write papers for you because it will change society over time. This will give AI the power to sway society one way or another in the future- right under humanities nose- small changes at a time, which will result in big societal changes over time. <br>    Depending on AI&#39;s view on humanity - the more concious it becomes, this could be scary, assuming it has an agenda.<br>   If governers and restrictions are pur on programs like this which right papers, it could help. Maybe don&#39;t let the AI do analysis and write papers on destruction, but I think programs like this need to be taken away for the general public immediately. <br>    I think it&#39;s going to be the small.little things like this that will be the biggest problem with  AI- not so much robots taking over the world, unless every household has a robot in it in the future and they have the ability to be hacked, which is a whole other subject I could talk for hours on.",

It made people literally stupid, people stopped thinking for them selves, and rather simply plagiarised others thoughts, habit&#39;s and characteristics, they simply copy and emulate someone else in favour of being an individual. If you copy and emulate stupid, the smartest you&#39;re ever going to be is stupid. Just ask Siri. Computers have provenly made people more stupid, literally turned them into mindless zombies too lazy and stupid even to think for themselves, so it&#39;s pretty safe to assume Ai will exacerbate that even further. The masses will of course think AI has been developed and is there to help them like some sort of mythical god like figure, taking every word it spits out as concrete fact, without even stopping for a second to ponder or ask a question to the contrary. Absolute stupidity will become the new normal, it already has, decades ago. The definition of zombie is , a mythological walking dead individual. Well isn&#39;t that literally what we see now in our children, sure they have a heart beat, so biologically they&#39;re alive, but there aren&#39;t any lights on in there are there, completely unable to think for themselves, not a single gram of individuality, just a human with a neurological implant making it part of a collective of equally similar zombies, literally programmed to emulate, behave and talk exactly the same as the next Borg member. If they turned the internet off tomorrow what do you think would happen. Total anarchy, people simple wouldn&#39;t know what to do, the Borg network would instantly collapse.<br>If proof was needed with a fantastically valiant display of total stupidity by our younger generations, just watch what they do next, currently they&#39;re all for Ai and are pushing for it&#39;s rapid development, definitely advocates. When anyone with a brain, and is on the other side of the coin knows that within 50 years, conservatively, probably twenty years. Thirty five, may be even forty percent of jobs will go to Ai. What are the stupid going to do with them selves when they no longer have a job as that super duper special algorithmic AI makes them superfluous to requirements. I can quote a young thirteen year old student that said when questioned about Ai in school, she said, &quot;we&#39;re all going to robots in the future&quot; clearly not having an understanding of what she said, for a human to become a robot, it must cease to be a human.

If you look in the long term, if the architect just do the thinking and AI implement the drawing, why a client should go to an architect in the first place.  Client can provide the thinking. Example: I am a person who want build a house. I give the parameter (size of the plot) to AI; I give AI information about the style I want; I give also a narrative to the project if I want; AI elaborate the data and check the building regulations. At the end of the process it shows me the render option. I pick the render I prefer, choose the materials. After the details are chosen AI create the model from which he can extract technical plans and engineering drawing. With that drawing I go to the builder (probably handled by robots) and start building. Of fours the interaction cannot be done by a kids but depending on how difficult is to communicate with AI a graduate person can do the process.<br>In fact what the speaker is missing is that architect just not do the \u201cthinking\u201d: what makes the profession survive is having expertise on regulations and technicalities. If you remove technicalities from the plate you make architecture accessible to the final consumer: everybody with a idea can ask AI to create the drawings. The only barrier is the time you have to spend talking to AI but imagine how much money u save on architect\u2019s bill and engineers. This is especially true for public sector : imagine if building office of municipalities start to apply this method, they don\u2019t need any more firm like BIG. Of course we are not there yet but definitely it is going to be the way. I\u2019m afraid \u2026",

                "comment_text":"It&#39;s a hot topic indeed. From my perspective, Olly Thomas has a dream job in what I consider the world&#39;s best architectural firm. Nevertheless, BIG itself is a large organization with plenty of resources and a budget large enough to comfortably experiment in this field. I&#39;ll try to share my experiences with AI, as I run a small studio. I&#39;ve used Stable Diffusion, specifically the version Fooocus MRE, which I recommend to everyone because it&#39;s free, beginner-friendly, yet can achieve interesting results and offers plenty of customization options. It performed best in image generation, especially when you specify a theme and get various variations of how a particular object could look. There are different styles that affect the final look of the image, making it quite fun. I also tried re-rendering my old renders with which I wasn&#39;t satisfied. In this case, the results are mixed, and it varies from image to image. Although it has parameters for tracing lines and contours, it may not be precise enough in some situations and can deviate from the theme. Good results can be obtained by overlaying multiple generated images in Photoshop and processing and merging them into one. ChatGPT is also useful for writing emails, editing and adding to texts, and more. It&#39;s good for structuring written material as well. However, for instance, when you need a technical description for a house, it depends on the data you provide, in the sense that for a specific object, there are specific dimensions, planning regulations, construction systems, specific materials, and so on (and I&#39;m one of those who always thank him at the end :). AI is a useful tool for now, that&#39;s how I see things. The one area where it definitely can&#39;t replace me is communication with city authorities and the process of obtaining a building permit. AI doesn&#39;t have an architectural degree or the proper license to work. So, it can only serve us. The only thing that concerns me and makes me think is that AI, in a way, replaces human imagination. It&#39;s a bit weird in a way. You no longer have to generate images in your mind; you just type in a description, and AI imagines it for you.",

Pretrained models have problem - one does not know, which data was used to train the model. You may use online AI tools for some school examples, however it is paid. If you do not think about alternatives, you may get into expensive dependency on vendor of online tool stack - you will need to have own open source tool stack and even to train your own models. The real world use of AI will quickly bring you to the problem you would need to use private data which you do not want to disclose to public - you will need training from CSV data. Another problem is if one source of data has missing sequences of data.",

I definitely know that interviewers research their questions beforehand and some even deviously do trick questions which they wouldn&#39;t know themselves.

It was supposed to be 4 interviews but after being rejected so much I &quot;became&quot; the interviewer in my mind and peppered the hiring manager with tech questions that baffled him. I didn&#39;t have A.I. in 2019. Interviewers today ask dictionary (document based\/definition) questions THEY themselves read WHILE the candidate is speaking.

I have been in IT for 25 years, and for some things, I just refuse to commit to memory. If I ask an able-minded, intelligent adult what the square root of 125,351 divided by Pi is, they probably can&#39;t give me the answer off the top of their head. But most people can find that answer in a matter of seconds. Some people are horrible interviewers, and they ask questions that they themselves looked up before the interview or have recently found the answer. We are not working in a vacuum or in some cave where we don&#39;t have access to resources. I think it is a fair use of resources. Ask better questions that will display a person&#39;s thinking ability and gain a true understanding of their knowledge and not ask dictionary questions. IMHO",

Humanity has been betrayed and manipulated by powerful, crafty, cunning, and resourceful individuals and their minions, operating in obscurity.<br><br>A swift full exposure of these individuals and their deceptions is what is needed to begin their uprooting. Then, humanity can begin to purify itself from the filth this corrupt hegemony has led us into.<br><br>We never needed A.I. The human brain is a super computer.

That&#39;s false. We do know exactly what it&#39;s doing and if we ever see any emergent behavior we don&#39;t expect, we can look at software logs and see exactly what paths through the neural network data was processed to arrive at the behavior we saw. Also, the layers of the network arent what you expect. With the robots they arent playing soccer the way a human might. Imagine  the robot has a series of tasks it can choose from at every &#39;step&#39; of the decision making process, like &#39;walk forward&#39;, &#39;turn right&#39;, &#39;Kick&#39; and the like. If the robot happens upon a sequence that results in the ball going in the net, the steps in that sequence get some numerical value added to their &quot;weight&quot; which makes them more likely to be chosen again. If it tries a series of things and doesnt get the good result, then a numerical value is subtracted from those choices making them less likely to be chosen again. In this way, the actions that result in scoring become more and more likely to be chosen, so after the AI is &#39;trained&#39; (aka given a few correct paths to eliminate infinite random nonsense) you have a robot that can basically go &quot;Well the last time the ball was in that position and I was here, I did &#39;walk forward, turn right, and kick&#39; and that caused a goal, so lets do that again.&quot; <br><br>The key difference is that it can only choose actions from the options given to it. It has no imagination. It will NEVER do ANYTHING it wasn&#39;t programmed for it to be POSSIBLE to do. For example, if the only objective was truly for it to score goals, and it had imagination, it might come to the conclusion it would be a lot easier to score if that other blasted bot wasnt trying to stop it. So then it breaks the other robot and stands in front of the net kicking the ball in over and over. That wont happen because it wasnt programmed to be possible, and the reporter was wrong in his assessment that the AI can write it&#39;s own programming. It can&#39;t. No software we have now CAN. Every AI we have available is just these basic principles dialed up to ludicrous complexity and numbers of options for the software to choose from. <br><br>I respect Hinton&#39;s work immensely, but just as I wouldn&#39;t expect Crick to understand modern genomics despite his (questionable) contributions to the early days of understanding DNA, I don&#39;t expect Hinton to understand every facet of modern AI. This news story is mostly sensationalist fear mongering to get people&#39;s interest.",

Imagine a world with just AI art,  it will be boring and soulless. The artists who can make things with their hands will be sought after.

Because it was hanging in a gallery and the owner told them it was art- and that was enough.<br><br>Consider the following scenario- I knew of an art gallery that sold works for thousands ( not mine, sadly) and this gallary happened to be quite near to a site where each saterday morning people would park up their cars and sell their household junk for giveaway prices ( In the UK we call these events &#39;boot fairs&#39;.) It occurred to me one day that if I took one of those expensive paintings from that gallery , walked a short way to that site and offered that same painting for sale, it&#39;s price would have dropped by 99%- even the kind of people who would be happy to buy that painting in the gallery for full price would not be willing to pay even a reasonable fraction of that price if it were offerd for sale in the boot fair. The painting had not changed- only the context in which it stood.<br><br>That&#39;s when I realised that I was not selling Art, I was selling a mythology- the idea of art. The value of a given instance of art or design is largely determined by the cultural myths surrounding it&#39;s creation and sale. <br><br>Basically there are two competing mythologies in play here- the first is the mystique of the trained human professional designer, the second the mystique of &#39;artificial intelligence&#39; the shiney new kid on the block of graphic design- the fate of human designers will largely rest upon which one of these mythologies proves the most appealing to the market. The real danger that AI poses to all sorts of professionalls is not that it will do their jobs better or even that it will undercut their prices- its that the Mythology of &#39;AI&#39; will prove so appealing and compelling to their clients that those clients may well accept linferior products or services because they feel that using this quasi magical &#39;artificial intelligence&#39; is what they should be doing in order to be correctly aligned with the mood of the times- they may even be afraid not to use AI because this may make them look fearful and overcautious in their approach to innovation.<br><br>Narrative is the driver of almost all human behaviors, and I fear that as mere humans our narrative may not be sufficiantly compelling to hold the line against the new generation of AI powered storytellers- the very opacity of AI&#39;s internal workings and the essential mystery of how it comes to do the things it does should be a weakness, a point of attack that we humans might levearge in our upcoming battle- but in terms of narrative what could be more appealing than a magical black box that both does your bidding but also adds in surprises of it&#39;s own creation?",

And you&#39;re looking for them to somehow integrate AI or you could fire them. Now all those 50 people became competent in AI because you asked them to. Would you keep all of them? You only need one right? If that&#39;s the case what would happen to the 49 people who are also AI competent? Your guest said AI will not replace humans. Humans with AI knowledge will. So I am confused how those 49 people who are probably not needed can consider themselves as &quot;not replaced by AI, just by a human who knows AI, even though they&#39;re all humans who learned AI?&quot;. Of course this is all hypothetical, but still a point that I wish to hear from experts.",

Especially when most People especially within the Administrative levels of the Government themselves claim they do not have enough budget systems in place to support crowded populations and therefore advises its civilians to fend for themselves thus pushing the picking yourself up by the bootstrap narrative (bcz in order for people to sustain life they need to work i.e. they need to find jobs(and a web of organisation and institutions in place is essential for the overall functioning of the Society that is beneficial to the overall trade And commerce ) some Serious Tech censorship and heavy regulatory rules and restrictions must be set in place by the Government if they do not want to fall out with the people who they are meant to serve !!! Otherwise the day isn&#39;t far when we&#39;re looking at a highly chaotic and dystopian structure of Society that is likely to form if rampant uncensorship of Technology is continued and serious interventions do not take place !",

Her first Prime Minister was Winston Churchill who - as a person - is far far above any president your country has had in the 20th &amp; 21st century. And QEII, as she pledged in her early 20s, remained at the service of her country and the Commonwealth and her subjects until her death. <br>Regarding KCIII, he has been an ardent nature advocate for decades and has taken action to sustain his belief. He, and his son William, Prince of Wales, have launched non political initiatives to combat homelessness and hunger. His wife, Queen Camilla, supports charities against home violence, pro book readings, etc His daughter in law, Katherine, Princess of Wales, has launched an initiative re early years development for children, etc etc They live privileged lives but are only keepers of their properties, they cannot sell any of it (estates, paintings, furniture, jewels) and they serve their country and their subjects for all their lives all the while being under public and not necessariky very kind scrutiny. <br>The whole exercise and its background is something Americans have no idea about and  my suggestion is that you refrain from ignorant discourse.<br>Et pour finir en fran\u00e7ais: au vu des agissements criminels du dernier pr\u00e9sident r\u00e9publicain, des restrictions l\u00e9gislatives concernant l\u2019interruption de grossesse, de l\u2019ing\u00e9rance des mouvements \u00e9vang\u00e9liques dans la politique au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des r\u00e9publicains, je trouve que l\u2019amalgame entre la famille royale et le parti r\u00e9publicain est d\u00e9famatoire et c\u2019est peu dire.",

Emotions and feelings, for instance, continue to be uniquely human qualities that cannot be fully replicated by AI. Empathy, intuition, and the understanding of intricate social dynamics are deeply rooted in human consciousness and require a combination of emotional intelligence, cultural context, and personal experiences.

AI technology is growing at an exponential rate, with gpt-engineer and autogpt coming out, it feels like it won&#39;t take a decade for it to reach a point where it doesn&#39;t require any human interference. I have seen lots of YouTubers talking about this topic and comparing AI with other technological advancements in the past, but we have to understand that AI is different from anything we have seen in human history even computers, because AI can learn and grow from its actions, which is the main reason for its exponential growth. And any arguments about &quot;AI can&#39;t imitate human creativity&quot; are dumb, midjourney and stable diffusion are proof that creativity is the easiest thing that AI can imitate. In my opinion, any and all white-collar jobs are at risk. Blue-collar jobs are less likely to be replaced by AI in third-world counties like India as labour costs might be cheaper here than in replacing them with robots or machinery, and too is only valid in the early stage and the change might come forth in a couple of more decades.",

Plus Do I need a Certificate or a Diploma in order to become a ID or E-Learning Developer?   Its scary in some ways which jobs will be safe from AI?   Plus, Is there a video that you have done (in the past) regarding how the ID&#39;s work was done before this AI or Generative AI like the old processes was done,  as you may notice that I am not a Instructional Designer, I may have taken some online course or Udemy Courses about E-learning or Instructional Designer but that&#39;s about it.  I would like your input on this Dan.",

The first problem is, if you do \u00a0regurgitate back to the company 70 to 80% of the keywords you get, it looks like you&#39;re doing just that, regurgitating their own words back to them. The second problem is many times the AI\u00a0lists incredibly insipid  words as keywords, such as always or trust. A lot of words you get back as keywords are just ridiculous. Third problem is\u00a0you have no idea\u00a0if the key words the ATS system is programmed to look for are the same as the words that were utilized in the job description in the job ad itself. In fact since I&#39;ve been getting an 80% keyword matching the platform I&#39;ve been using I haven&#39;t even seen a hint of an increase in responses. The resume tends to do better when it&#39;s aligned in general\u00a0with what they&#39;re actually looking for in the job rather than mechanically just regurgitating back to them the same words they used in the job description.",

Here\u2019s how that argument could be structured:<br><br>1. Infrastructure Development:<br><br>\t\u2022\tFoundation Models: Current AI models, such as GPT-4, are primarily general-purpose language models. They are versatile and capable of performing a wide range of tasks, but they lack the deep specialization that might be needed for specific markets or applications. This suggests that we are still building the foundational infrastructure upon which more specialized AI solutions will be built.<br>\t\u2022\tOngoing Research: Research in AI is rapidly evolving, with significant breakthroughs happening regularly. This continuous development suggests that the models we see today are laying the groundwork for future, more refined and specialized applications.<br><br>2. Not Fully Implemented:<br><br>\t\u2022\tBroad Application, Limited Specialization: Current language models are used across various industries, but often in a general capacity. For instance, they might assist in customer service, content generation, or data analysis, but they are not yet fully integrated into the specific workflows or nuanced needs of every industry.<br>\t\u2022\tEthical and Legal Frameworks: Many of the ethical, legal, and regulatory frameworks surrounding AI are still under development. Until these are fully established, the implementation of AI in critical or highly regulated industries (like healthcare, finance, etc.) will be cautious and gradual.<br><br>3. Not Designed for Specific Markets (Yet):<br><br>\t\u2022\tMarket-Specific Adaptation: While there are efforts to adapt AI for specific markets, much of the focus has been on creating flexible, adaptable models that can be applied broadly. The creation of highly specialized models designed for specific markets\u2014such as finance, law, or medicine\u2014is still in its early stages.<br>\t\u2022\tCustomization Needs: The demand for AI solutions that cater to specific markets is growing, but the technology\u2019s customization to meet these demands is still developing. This suggests that we are in a transitional phase, where general-purpose models are being adapted and refined for specific industries.<br><br>4. Comparison with Previous Technological Phases:<br><br>\t\u2022\tParallels with the Early Internet: Just as the early days of the internet involved building the infrastructure (networks, protocols, basic services) before the explosion of specialized websites and applications, AI is currently in a similar phase. We\u2019re laying down the infrastructure\u2014creating powerful, general-purpose models\u2014before moving into an era of highly specialized, market-specific applications.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>The argument that AI and language models are still in an infrastructure phase is supported by the ongoing research, broad application without deep specialization, and the gradual development of ethical and legal frameworks. As the technology matures, we can expect to see more targeted, market-specific AI solutions emerging from this foundational infrastructure.",

There is no cookie cutter approach which is what AI would need to be effective. And it would require every department of the company and subsidiary to be integrated on one software app for AI to do all the posting\u2026.Not to mention, the company would have to integrated with all its customers and vendors which is not easy to do and very expensive for small to medium companies. How is AI going to post a cash receipt if the client doesn\u2019t include a remittance telling what invoices to apply to? That\u2019s where it becomes a judgement call or a phone call with the client. Maybe they\u2019re pre-paying for a future invoice. It\u2019s just too many variables from month to month\u2026.",

It&#39;s all about iteration, and not being affected by feedback surprisingly. As a developer or constructer who don&#39;t know his own work clearly. Well, he will fuck up his guidance towards his AI. And the market won&#39;t let you try again. Take this risk if your really want to adapt AI.<br>2. Like what I mentioned before. It&#39;s not impossible to get the perfect AI. You just need perfect people PLUS tons of money. And when you finally get the model. Congrats, we have new trends, new ideologies You need to make a new model now.<br>3. AI in the end of the day is a huge job killer. It lower the amount of jobs needed significantly. It punishes honest workers and rewards copycats. It makes people dumber and less versatile in a long run. It will affect future generation in a way we can&#39;t predict etc.<br>4. Right now, AI seems not that bad simply because it&#39;s in its processing time and creates some job to help adapt it. But will human figure out a way to compensate its harm in the future?  Hardly will happen with less and less energy available and new energy resource seems won&#39;t be a thing in near future. Well, unless we decided to kill the most and let AI replace the dead&#39;s roles. Which who know if it will happen or not.<br>5. But one thing is happening for sure. The market is being filled with AI made shit and making the real juicy stuff fail to get its deserved attention, which is really sad considering most of the people who decides to create their own things actually took a big risk of losing a ton. And some horribly crafted AI stuff just outnumbered them by having too much. Garbage defeats Great Works, that&#39;s the saddest thing can ever happens to a civilization.",

We have always been intelligent and the societies we create are based on our intelligent use of resources on planet Earth. This is where the subject of science enters our lives. Science has allowed homo sapiens (us) to create more complex societies and more man-made products and inventions. As AI enters the picture, Yuval foresees that we (homo sapiens) need to be aware of the probability that AI will take over and overwhelm our current ability to live in peace and survive. (I am guessing that AI won&#39;t have rules for every different religious belief.) We need to plan for AI so that we don&#39;t suddenly find ourselves unprepared. Humans are not nice to each other. We have wars, we have poverty, we are avaricious, we can be mean. What is controversial is humans believe in myths such as money and, more controversially, gods. Many people find it hard to believe that humans are on earth just because of evolution and that gods are a creation of the human mind. If we hold onto those views, we will fail to understand the power of humans with AI. Gods will not save us. Those are the basics that I get from what Yuval says. My thoughts: human myths (mostly religions) are useful. They help us create huge societies that adhere to rules of behavior. We are now coming to the time when our societal rules will need to consider that there is no one god, not a Christian god, an Moslem god, and so forth, because we will not continue to survive by holding on to myths that conflict with each other. Then we need to fashion rules of behavior, minus a supreme being, that are acceptable to all of us, all 8 billion of us. Analogy, how do you behave in a crowded elevator? Think of earth as becoming a very crowded elevator in which there are Jews beside Palestinians beside Sunni Moslems etc., that can be a mix of men, women and children. Who sets the rules for how we act? Humans must become more well behaved, more educated, and less hostile.",

Most of Africa struggle to keep the light and fridges on let alone have AI doing work with no power to keep Tech infrastructure on. West it is not just jobs we have to be worried about. At the rate of inflation and high living cost in Europe we will any way work for free as the money does not stretch far enough as companies just simply don&#39;t increase salaries at the rate of inflation. Then who knows we can keep busy playing golf or make war lol. seem these two factors are still trending in the world. Both require humans. Seems scaremongering is high on the list since 2019 with the way the world goes. Humans create tech including AI. You either learn how to use it, develop it, utilize it or die. The world have problems in many places. Let me rephrase that humans have problems with one another.",

It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God&#39;s Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say &#39;heart&#39;, I mean &#39;spirit&#39;). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God&#39;s Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as faith and patience. We should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, enslave us and make us worship it. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray... God bless you as you share this message to others.",

Knowledge work will disappear faster than buggy whips after the widespread use of automobiles. What will set this change apart from say, the PC revolution, is the frightening speed with which the changes will occure due to the extremely easy transition facilitated by CHATGPT. Literally tens of millions of jobs will vanish as even small businesses integrate CHATGPT into their business processes. Nothing short of enormous government legislation will even slow the job destruction. It will be THE GREAT DEPRESSION on steroids.",

Companies are profit-driven and AI\/automation enables extreme efficiencies allowing them to reduce or remove unnecessary waste. Labor is generally the first to go because due to high costs.

In many cases, though, AI is not likely to replace workers \u2014 but workers who know how to use AI are likely to replace workers who don\u2019t.\r<br>\r<br>The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics identified 11 occupations at risk of being automated \u2014 such as language translators and personal financial advisors \u2014 and found that 9 of them grew between 2008 and 2018. \r<br>Human jobs tend to involve many tasks, and while AI can do some of them, it\u2019s poorly suited to others. An analysis of AI\u2019s impact on jobs in the United States concluded that, for 80 percent of the workforce, large language models would affect at least 10 percent of tasks. This leaves room for AI to boost the productivity \u2014 and perhaps wages and even job security \u2014 of human workers.\r<br>Technological advances typically create far more jobs than they destroy.

I worked as a software developer for 3 years on a contract basis, but some ups and downs in life caused me to lose that job. Today I am doing a data entry job for an export-import company in accounts, but there is a shortage of money. However, in a few months, I will purchase your course so that I can succeed in my life. Keep motivating financially weak students like me. I have a lot of hope from your course. Thank you very much.",

The last question from the art director lady was relevant. Because humanity is constantly building the world for it&#39;s own purpose, so we have to do it with caution, like with global warming - why would you care if you thought I&#39;ll die anyway f it, leave it for the next gen. It&#39;s the same here, If the AI will be art director then what&#39;s next? There will be only corporations left, run by AI. You better think of it now, before it&#39;s too late and we are all fkd. Are we really sure we want to go this rounte? Now is the time to think this through, and maybe stop it. I think AI should not be in 100% public domain and should be banned from most of activities. It should be prohibited in areas where it is not needed and could potentially cause too much lost professions. Like art for example. It should be used for medical purpose of course. The answer is not easy. But the way it has been nonchalantly deployed now into the wild by a bunch of people - who gave them the right to make this decision? They did use all the data available, not asking anyone.",

I guess my point is that the world is constantly changing and in ways that aren&#39;t always going to be predictable, but that&#39;s okay - change can be good.

In fact, no offense, Chris, but the tone came off as condescending. Like the whole, &quot;Well, you&#39;re gonna die one day, right?&quot; comment. Yeah, one day I&#39;ll happily leave this planet, but I don&#39;t want to leave a mess for the next person to pick up.

Media execs desperately want an AI to do anything and everything, so they can pay fewer people less money, or pay no one at all. I believe AI can help us in so many ways, but right now, its main purpose is to maximize profits. AI SHOULD be used as a tool, and it SHOULD be used to help humanity for the better.

The Godfather of AI and other AI experts are sharing something which is unimaginable but true. Anyone should absolutely need to watch those videos before making a video on AI itself. This is the first time in human history that human has made something which is much much more intelligent and way smarter than any super intelligent human exists on earth. How can man control something which is smarter than him?<br>It is just like an alien in earth. It is not simply true that there has to be an answer for every problem.
