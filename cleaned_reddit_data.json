nobody try debate undesirable development want know advantage vehicle well human flawed many accident happen due driver error human get distracted sick insist driving drunk high drug medication experience fainting sudden bout fatigue stroke etc cause accident removing human component accident related failure human behavior like rekless driving way due failure body due various condition second major advantage self driving car promise reduce overall number car sold per year driven road thus knock effect reducing pollution production new car well pollution due disposing larger number

hand semantically equivalent symbol close input embedding space hand conditionally equivalent symbolsthose conditional probability across context p p close output space back draft first timewith new experiment hand revised draft introducing concept conditional equivalence theorem connecting output embeddings allowed clearly articulate conditional equivalence reflected output embeddingsas writing struck weight tying wt technique often employed scenario led new question happens use wt symbol conditionally equivalent semantically equivalent one hand symbol close input embedding space hand far apart output embedding space different conditional probability however wt input output space tied together making impossible two symbol simultaneously close far apartthis realization sent back experiment investigate particular setting back experiment second timein previous experiment established probability seeing b given context let introduce another layer complexity replacing symbol symbol x time x probable change dataset something like thissamplelabelxyaxxeaxxaxyebybaxyexxxbbxeyxbbaydwhen train mlm model dataset easy observe input embedding space x become close like b x semantically equivalent however unlike b x get close output embedding space different conditional probabilitiesnow happens tie embeddings observe b converge quickly x remain distanced additionally noticed training becomes bit unstablethe distance x fluctuates significantly training overall untied model tends perform better likely avoids conflicting requirement imposed weight tying back draft third timei quite pleased result obtained eagerly incorporated paper revising also discussed idea weight tying wt used conditionally equivalent symbol also semantically equivalent expressed asor conciselywhile discussing property realized explanation closely mirrored hypothesis similar word similar context concept later discovered known distributional hypothesis made whole paper click together restructured work around central conceptif accept formalization distributional hypothesis semeqv iff cndeqv follows wt employed hypothesis hold true submission reviewswith icml next major conference horizon decided submit work review helpful positive recurring critique lack largescale experimentsi simply understand obsession experiment require hundred gpus mean submitted paper mostly theoretical aiming explain wellknown phenomenon supported vast literature isnt small controlled experiment enough included mostly make paper selfcontained backed literaturewell nobody research community furthermore first publication big conference like icml complied kind still one gpu experiment access although experiment add practically anythingin end thrilled paper accepted spotlight poster huge milestone making feel like genuine researcher field dedicated almost month preparing poster video presentation viewed effort well worth conference presentationon day conference arrived

attended great tutorial presentation physic language modelin next day made friend talked lot people included alfredo canziani incredible ai communicator randall balestriero incredible scientist field saw also michael bronstein course always surrounded could bring talk himthe last poster session time present quite nervous first time presenting conference surprise many attendee werent familiar distributional hypothesisa concept assumed everyone would know even though hadnt known term made question effectiveness paper marketing presentation title etc perhaps emphasized semantics aspect moreone particularly memorable interaction tall guy deepmind listened part presentation pointed polite manner theorem might correct confident proof reviewed phd student mathematics math competition debated back forth understood argument involved specific construction embedding matrix right argument broke one theorem assumption know even showing hypothesis poster believe anyone would interested detail guy practically deeper understanding theorem without listening half presentation without full hypothesis well conclusion deepmind freaking guy working conclusion use weight tying distributional hypothesis hold deepmind incredible people go tutorial hr sleep hr okay though writing paper crucial previously believed experiment come first realize importance writing idea early putting thought word often clarifies integrates concept way experiment alone may perhaps valuable lesson ive learned paper limitation future worksif youre considering using wt technique might wonder dh actually hold apply specific problem apply natural language task generalanswering question challenging may always feasible consequently work may limited practical utility simply push question applying wt dh hold however suspect dh partially hold natural language might explain llm use wtso idea useful run training wt certain point untie embeddings allow difference token conditionally eqv semantically eqv vice
